The HardenedBSD project has corrected a lot of its shortcomings in the last few months to ease the user experience, I can only recommend to test and use it again.I especially like the fact that the ports are more up-to-date than freebsd.In terms of security, the ASLR of HardenedBSD is particularly robust and the highest of all BSD (just compare with paxtest).The HardenedBSD project seems to be well advanced on the generalization of CFI which will make it a must-have OS in terms of security.To be followed and encouraged with interest.

This distro is very sadly under rated. I have been an Arch Linux user for the past 5 years and the only other distro that I have ever switched to is Debian, until now. OpenMandriva is now my main operating system it is very agile and everything that I have thrown at it works. I gave it only a 9 rating because in the etc file system the printing functions should be activated and not left to the user to do so, because not all users would know how to do this especially new users to Linux. Also, using both RPM and DNF as installers really coners all posiible applications install posibilities. I was using Mandrake way pack in 1997 and helped wrote scripts for dependencies and after Mandrake and then when Mandriva took over I sighed with relief that it was still being worked on at that time, but when they gave up and some of the coders deceided to keep it alive at that point I switched between Arch and Debian and sadly totally forgot about Mandriva until now. Welcome back Mandriva I really did miss you."
2,2023-07-07, OpenMandriva Lx, 23.03,10,5,"    I to use Mandriva back in the old days but after trying their non-rolling version I decided to try the rolling version and its a great experience. Uses Calamares to install which went pretty quickly and you have a decent amount of apps at first boot. Falkon and Chromium are the two browsers, with LibreOffice already installed. It uses its own system update manager thru Konsole and Discover simplu doesnt work to update the system. Discover though is the source for Flatpaks and DNFDragora is the package manager and it works very well. The welcome control center is handy especially for new users who arent as experienced . Codecs are installed by default so no multimedia issues. Hardware detection is good as my wifi was seen but the printer was a no go. System config printer is installed so I checked and installed the Canon printer driver and it was seen and installed.     The speed of the system is noticeably faster than some other distros I use and memory usage was very reasonable. The overall appearance of OM is amazing, one of the more beautiful distros Ive seen  with even more choices available. KDE 5.27.5 and the 6.3.5 kernel are installed which didnt cause any issues with my Dell Optiplex 7010 sff nor my Lenovo Thinkcentre m900 tiny.   There were a few issues though, such as Discover not being able to update the system, more than likely by design. Then I noticed when adding or removing favorites in the menu, the changes dot happen immediately. You end up having to logout then login and then it works. Its a bug they apparently are aware of but haven't fixed yet. Overall the user experience is excellent. The iso isa 2.6gb which isnt too bad and you can also try other DE's. The forums are petty responsive which I appreciated after some bad experiences with other forums.   I liked this distro enough to switch over to it as a long term OS and see how it does but its a nice change of pace from all the Debian, Ubuntu and Arch clones.  Give it a try and I think youll find it a great experience. "
3,2023-04-07, OpenMandriva Lx, 23.03,8,8,First I have to say I did not have any issues installing the distro. I have read that some had blank screens and crashes I did not. There were some small isssues that I had to resolve myself like printing and Latte not all apps icons stayed put. Getting past these small issues Open Mandriva Lx is very fast and it is very stable. I have been an Arch Linux user for more then 5 years but right now Open Mandrive Lx is my main driver and I am very happy using it. It also uses less ram for some strange reason then Arch and handles my Nvidia driver without any issues. It also intergrates with Flatpak seamlessly much better then Arch Linux as an example. I can not compare this with other distros such as Debian or Ubuntu since I do not use those other distros but Arch I will say that it can and does do some things better then Arch Like Flatpak and Nvidia drivers intergartion as n example. I gave it a 8 rating only because of those small issues and to be honest I have never given any distro a 10 not even Arch Linux.Hope this has been helpful.Cheers
4,2023-03-08, OpenMandriva Lx, 23.01,10,8,"I had to choose the version as 23.01, but the latest version of Rome is 23.03.I have been using Openmandriva since it was born, after having used Mandriva and Mandrake for a long time.Over the past 3 years it has become my main distro.I am very satisfied with Openmandriva: it is fast, stable and complete. No problems with installation, customization and daily use.The rolling release has all the software up to date, but very rarely do I suffer from blockages of the programs or of the entire system.Forum support is very good, both in English and Italian, problems are quickly addressed and resolved by the support team. There is certainly a lot still to be done, but I would recommend the distro to average Linux users."
5,2023-01-30, OpenMandriva Lx, 23.01,10,20,"Unlike the reviewer in DW Weekly, I can't find any instability in this rolling release. It works flawlessly. No crashes during installation, no X11 crashes, no Plasma crashes even with full graphical effects.It includes everything a normal user will need, and it's all working and the components go well together. No weirdness of different applications using different button order (""Yes|No"" vs. ""No|Yes"") that plagues some other distros.If you're looking for something that ""just works"", give OpenMandriva a try!"
6,2023-01-27, OpenMandriva Lx, 23.01,9,4,"I have been wandering from countless distro to distro, to find a perfect distro. Ubuntu family is always my place to go home, because everything just works without hassle. I was curious about OpenMandriva znver architecture, bacuse I have a ryzen laptop. So I gave it a try and suprisingly, it works very well on my laptop. Everything works by default, don't need to install anything. Also, it runs fast and responsive.For a while I will dig deeper to this beautiful distro. Maybe would be my future destination to stay."
7,2023-01-17, OpenMandriva Lx, 23.01,10,3,"As a distro hopper this version impressed with speed(boot up) install, and aesthetically pleasing overall build. Been using about 3+ weeks and all my favorite packages were available and installed and ran perfectly. Still stable after several updates. Installed on high performance nvme in genuine USB 3.2 Ver 2 enclosure with near max performance. Faster that many of my computers. I recommend you check it out. Its a keeper!  My small lenovo quad core atom laptop has had manjaro running for over 4 years faultlessly. The Rome 23.01 is the only other distro I will consider. Strictly a KDE person. "
8,2023-01-14, OpenMandriva Lx, 23.01,10,8,"Typing this from Open Mandriva Rolling release. This distro deserves top spot, I did have one freeze during installation but a reboot and fresh install sorted that out. Please dont expect everything to be perfect (its a rolling release) and you get the freshest packages to date including kernel.For an rpm distro this blows fedora out of the water and is miles quicker. The new control centre is spot on and a nice feature to have. The desktop by default is the best themed kde desktop out of the box and there is no need to change anything.The Team have done an excellent job putting this together and having a Mandriva based rolling distro is by far the best way to go as I dont like to keep installing a new system every 6 to 10 months.I suggest to anyone looking at this distro to just install it. Should the install freeze just reboot and start again, it will work then but dont let the computer screen go off into standby as this is what froze my first install attempt."
9,2023-01-13, OpenMandriva Lx, 23.01,10,6,"Astonished, Having used Fedora for years, I literally jumped on a whim to OpenMandriva LX (Rome), why, just for a laugh really.  I testing out a new Micro-SD card in a fancy adapter and used an OpenMandriva live image for that purpose. It was an independent release, not based on anything, its why I chose it,  which is why I was using Fedora in the first place, I just went with the base KDE set up as I did not expect to be still using it after I had tested the Micro-SD card's speed, etc.I was astonished at its speed on the SD card, I formatted my fedora 37 (Gnome) SSD and installed OpenMandriva LX (Rome).Installation was a breeze and very quick, booting up is fast, in fact everything about OpenMandriva LX is a massif performance boost over my old OS. The Desktop is light years away from Gnome and for the better. I have everything I want or need downloaded and installed without any problems, I use several VPNs and love the way the internet connection when establishing also establishes my preferred VPN at the same time, small thing I know but efficient all the same. Still finding my feet with KDE, but I think Gnome has had its day with me as has Fedora. I'm converted."
10,2023-01-13, OpenMandriva Lx, 23.01,6,0,"There were issues trying to get sshd enabled. It would start on demand, but not enable for automatic system load. Also, network issues happened when changed from DHCP to Fixed IP Address.It is a nice looking distro.  The KDE implementation is very nice. I really like that they have put together a rolling release.  However, it is just not quite there yet.The default programs are pretty good.  However, Falkon as the default browser could be better.  Firefox is not installed by default.  It is easy enough to install; just a bit peculiar.Package Management system is very nice and works well.  I appreciate the different repositories.  That was a nice touch.The installation was flawless.  Everything worked and was very easy."
11,2023-01-09, OpenMandriva Lx, 23.01,1,0,"Would love to leave a great review about how wonderful and stable OM is, however after several attempts to install it and having the installer crash it becomes impossible to do. If they seem to have issues with their calamares installer then it brings into question the stability of the system overall.If a person is fairly confident in their terminal and want a rolling release model, then Void may be a better option. I will return to Void. It was my thought that using something that has been around as long as OM that they should have everything down solid. For some reason it just isn't there."
12,2023-01-07, OpenMandriva Lx, 23.01,10,3,"I was skeptical but I tried the ROME - rolling release version and this will probably be my new default system. It works flawlessly and is fast - I think it works more efficiently than Opensuse Tumbleweed.Fresh packages list reminds me Arch but this OpenMandriva is a way more stable than Arch.Really nice distro. Worth to try if you looking for new packages updates, really well optimized and three package managers to choose: default one dnf, upcoming beta dnf5 also well known from suse - zypper.I can recommend this release."
13,2022-11-10, OpenMandriva Lx, 4.3,9,4,"Personally, I'm only interested in five criteria in an operating system: fast and foolproof installation, simple operation, as few updates as possible, acceptable security level, stability. That is the case with OM. The Calamares installer is famous for its simplicity, everything is fast. In the so-called rock branch, practically nothing is updated unless it has to be (I like that); the packages are up-to-date enough. Every 12 months a new version is released and then I invest 10 minutes to wipe the SSD and to reorganize the system. With flatpaks I keep my browsers or office software up to date or also use the Chrome or Edge browser as rpm package. Everything is very stable, as are Debian, Opensuse and Ubuntu LTS but OM being somehow more streamlined and simple at the same time. "
14,2022-10-12, OpenMandriva Lx, 4.3,10,3,"After many years and many Linux distros, I must say how brilliant OpenMandriva is!  It's been around for a while so why is something so good not getting more attention? The stable Rock version works well on a 14 year old laptop. What you get is a professional distro that's well featured out of the box, simple to use with Fedora style dnf commands, and quick enough on the old hardware. Speeds when updating and installing software via terminal is especially impressive.  Also like that the Rock version has a modern kernel and only requires minimal updates.OpenMandriva has firmly joined ranks with my favourite Debian distros if wanting a low maintenance easy stable system."
15,2022-09-05, OpenMandriva Lx, 5.0-candidate,10,6,"Tried OpenMandriva 5.0 ROME silver candidate primarily out of curiosity, to see what happened to the very first Linux distribution I tried back in the late 1990s.I was very positively surprised - while all the things that made Mandriva good back in its day (very easy to use, but without giving up the flexibility an advanced user wants) are still there, the things that made the user experience a bit weird back then (out of place perl-GTK configuration tools on a KDE desktop etc.) have been fixed.It is also a lot faster. I wonder what they did to make this happen. Is it clang?I'm straying from my original plan and not switching back to Fedora. This is better."
16,2022-07-29, OpenMandriva Lx, 4.3,2,2,"This experience is about openmandriva Lx 4.3.installed this OS just to see how Mandrake OS has evolved.OS performance was smooth and brought back Mandriva memories.Pros:boot loader,login screen,wallpaper,taskbar overall theme is very beautiful.Open Mandriva Control center, provides option to configure settings very easily instead of using command line.has option to set theme like ubuntu,windows,Mac OSmost of the HW was detected and performed well.provides DNF package manager, which is blazing fast.comes with KDE plasma as default DE, it uses around 1.2 GB upon initial boot.apps opens and rsponds quickly.Cons:the only Con which forced me to uninstall was Brightness keys were not working after following all possible Steps,was stuck with LCD screen with Max Brightness for whole time..Wiki and Forum has very less documentation/Q&A."
17,2022-07-27, OpenMandriva Lx, 4.3,10,3,"I installed by accident OpenMandriva on my laptop. Fedora / Open Suse was supposed to work but I had an issue with my usb key.I've been using it daily since one week and it's working great. Astonished by the performance, I won't go back to xfce. As someone said earlier, OM is an underrated distro. If you stick to the main repo you won't be able to use some fancy apps but the stability is great. I'm exciting to check how it will perform with the 5.x upgrade. Anyway adding other repo is quiet easy if you want more packages.Tiny community doesn't mean that slow, you can share your feedback, test or contribute as you can to make the project go forward.Give it a try ;-)"
18,2022-07-18, OpenMandriva Lx, 4.3,10,3,"By far the best distro I've ever tried (and I've tried many). Whoever said ""KDE"" and ""fast"" don't go together should take a look at this distro to see how it's done right.KDE on OpenMandriva feels as snappy as some of the lightweight desktops on other distros. Even on my trusty old laptop from 2012.The community around this distro is small, but great. Where else can you bring up a feature you're missing on IRC and someone builds a working prototype (in this case, om-repo-picker) within a day? Granted, probably I was just lucky there. I still don't think another distro could pull it off."
19,2022-04-15, OpenMandriva Lx, 4.3,10,6,"When I was using this distro, I switched my repos to the the rolling branch. It was done pretty easily with a gui tool and upgrading through the terminal. Openmandriva is heavily underrated. Its a solid distro that seems to need more manpower with how their repos and packages are managed. When I was using it, Kate in LX 4.3 was slightly higher version then the rolling branch one. Which is quite odd. I'd suggest leaving the stable releases in a semi-Debian style where they only get security updates. The rolling release should be the one with stable enough packages to roll over. Like Arch or Fedora or how Opensuse does it but without the snapshot style. Cooker can stay as cooker as the development branch. Overall I love that they strongly emphasize KDE Plasma. Their tweaks to it are beautiful and I hope to see more of it. Though I will say, there's far too many apps installed by default. Falkon is an odd choice of a default browser. It uses dnf and that can be speed up. For some reason, dnfdragora works pretty well compared to Fedora. Pretty fast. BUT THAT'S NOTHING COMPARED TO DNFDRAKEdnfdrake is amazing. It uses a terminal style interface with qt gui and it works so much better. I can't understand why its not installed by default. It should be front and center as a selling point of the distro. I love it!This distro can improve alot and add more packages catered to gaming and zsh for the terminal. But overall, I want to use it again. I love it. Its been rock solid. I love their control center. "
20,2022-02-24, OpenMandriva Lx, 4.3,9,2,"OpenMandriva 4.3 is a surprisingly nice distro! Everything works very well right out of the box. The installation was blazingly fast, and the Plasma 5 setup is very nice. I used ""dnf"" from the terminal to update, remove, and install software, and that happened very quickly and flawlessly. It's also refreshing that the RAM usage drops back to ""fresh boot"" levels after closing all running applications. I rarely see this these days, particularly with the likes of Fedora. The changes I made from the defaults included:Removed:* Falkon* Kmail* Elisa (seriously, awful music player, why is everyone packaging this now? Part of Plasma these days, I guess). Side note: removing Elisa DIDN'T try to take all of KDE along with it. Hello, Debian and Ubuntu-based distros!Installed:* Firefox* Thunderbird* Strawberry (now THAT is a music player!)* htop* neofetchAlready comes with LibreOffice and vlc, so that's covered. Next steps will include GIMP, Inkscape, and Scribus.The only issue that kept me from giving OM a 10 was the inability to set up my Brother printer. Off to the forums to troubleshoot that one. Otherwise, it has been fast, stable, consistent, and reliable.Hardware used is a ThinkPad T61, 8GB of RAM, 500GB HDD. Not exactly a spring chicken, but OM with Plasma 5 is very fast on this rig, more so than other distros with Plasma 5. As it stands now, OM is in the top 5 running to install to my much beefier desktop production rig.                                                                                                     "
21,2022-02-15, OpenMandriva Lx, 4.3,10,1,"I haven´t used OpenMandriva until now - I have to say that I am very pleased with it. Thanks to the Calamares installer the installation is very fast and easy. My software needs are fulfilled, good flatpak support if needed. The OS is also easy to use and I really like the possibility to change from a rock solid fixed release model to the rolling release model just by a few clicks (no command line action).Obviously an underrated distro with an elegant look. "
22,2022-02-10, OpenMandriva Lx, 4.3,8,0,"Up until now I have been using Linux Mint, which just works.I had, however, been looking for a distro using Plasma that wouldn't break when updating (as Manjaro tends to do) and that doesn't irritate me in as Neon does when updating.I discovered Mandriva Lx4.3 thanks to Distrowatch and installed it on an Intel machine and a Ryzen Slimbook.As to whether it will prove reliable, I shall have to wait and see.In the meantime I find it legible and elegant - in short, highly enjoyable to work with."

I don't know why OM sticks to Plasma as there are alternatives out there and if I had had a choice maybe I would have stuck around a bit longerCalamares was new to me and coming from the likes of PCLinuxOS and Mageia very strange.  The other two distros have more or less kept to the old Mandriva way of doing things and having cut my teeth on Mandrake they just feel more familiar.  I don't agree with the Open Mandriva  claim to be a direct descendant of Mandriva.  They seem to have moved quite a long way away from the original, unlike the other two. I can't recommend Open Mandriva based on my very fleeting experience but for someone not steeped in the old Mandrake ways may fare better.An interesting experience but not one I will follow up."

27,2021-08-05, OpenMandriva Lx, 4.2,1,9,"I started out on Mandrake way back when.  I think it is sad that most of the Mandrake forks have vanished over the years.  There are only a few left now.  I love Mandrake's technology and innovations, but the open source continuance has issues, namely in KDE Plasma.  It is so resource heavy that it installed without a hitch, but majorly slowed my computer to the point that it is largely unusable.  Tweaking KDE Plasma is nearly impossible,  both because it seems to be hardwired and because the system is so bogged down that it takes forever to do anything.  Other forks of Mandrake/Mandriva are PC Linux OS (PCLOS) and Mageia, and I would recommend using them.  At least they offer Xfce and Mate as alternatives and community editions have other interfaces that can be used in PCLOS, and the big install disks of Mageia have other interfaces to choose from.  I don't understand why a distro would put all its eggs into the most resource heavy baskets.  One of the goals of Linux is to be leaner, faster and lighter than Windows, but really resource heavy interfaces like KDE Plasma and Gnome totally defeat that purpose.  If you are looking for a distro that works fast and is based off of Mandrake technology, I would say go PC Linux OS or Mageia, at least you can get a lighter weight version.  If you have an uber computer with muscle to spare, you can Open Mandriva, otherwise give it a pass, unless they offer some lighter weight alternatives."

The distro feels complete in every sense, for example there's no half-way houses or clunky work-arounds giving a feeling of being very complete. I used this as my daily driver for three days and liked it very much. I'm generally accustomed to MX Linux KDE, and to a lesser extent, Manjaro KDE around the workplace or the trusty Mint XFCE on all mobile equipment so I'm comparing my experiences with this distro directly with them. All in all I feel that if I had to switch over to OpenMandriva Lx tomorrow I would be very happy to do so. It certainly feels speedy which is always a good thing for those bothered by such things. If I had to be picky the only thing that struck me during my second day of use was with Dolphin, there's no apparent way to right-click and navigate as root.. an annoyance with Manjaro too so not unusual but MX Linux does allow this which to my mind is the right way to go.So overall then, very nice indeed."

Bedrock linux allows multiple Linux distributions together without a need of VM or a Multi-boot environments.You can have different distributions installed and run a program from a certain distro from within currently booted ditribution without need of VM.I really liked the concept as I need CentOS as my primary system for development and then I need cutting edge distribution for running latest versions of various applications.I am currently running Ubuntu 22.10 on top of Cent OS 9 with latest release (4.18) of XFCE applications like thunar."

Very slow to install and desktop sluggish at times once up and running. Slow to install packages, but that's Apt for you. Some kernel errors just after post which I've never encountered before on this laptop with any other Linux distributions. Chromium seems to be the default web browser. I removed it and installed Firefox but it's a Snap package, which is disappointing. Have to jump through hoops to get a regular install for some reason. Everything else seems okay, but I'm probably not going to keep this one. Artix Linux with KDE is my favorite setup, but on this ePC I need something a bit lighter."

It falls short in speed compared to other Ubuntu based Xfce desktops. Somehow I feel filesystems to be quite slow but did not do investigation on root cause. It's strange a bit to have Chrome as default browser, perhaps it is by the creators personal taste. It could be a very good OS some day, but I think it still has a long way to reach this goal."
43,2023-06-04, Linux Lite, 6.4,10,1,"It's a great distro for old PCs and notebooks: simple and works fine! The bootload is fast. I try this distro in an old notebook (Aspire E1-571 with 8GB Ram) and works fine and stable for developing with Node.js and React.js.Others test that I have done was with Zorin OS Lite, but the Linux Lite works better. The UI it has good feedback when you need to run or switch to a new program. The snap is available and it simplifies install packages and softwares. About UI: this distro isn't beautiful but isn't ugly as well. You can personalize all you want, and dark theme is available - I love dark themes. "

I attempted to install Windows 10 and 11 on it and got blue screens and boot loops at different points during the installations. Next, tried Zorin and Elementary. Installed successfully. Both were usable but hung up on daily basis. Then I tried Fedora and Linux Mint. Again, both were usable but hung up on weekly basis, especially when when using Chrome. Finally, I tried Linux Lite. It works like magic. It has been very stable for more then six months. I tried it on my cousin's defected computer. It works smoothly without any problems."
45,2023-05-06, Linux Lite, 6.4,10,8,"Linux Lite is a lightweight and user-friendly operating system based on Ubuntu that can run on low-end hardware. After testing it on your laptop, here is my review of Linux Lite.Firstly, the installation process was straightforward and fast. The system requirements are very low, and it runs smoothly on your laptop. The desktop environment is very similar to Windows 7, which makes it easy for Windows users to adapt to it. Additionally, the menu is organized, making it easy to find installed applications.In terms of software, Linux Lite comes with many pre-installed applications that are essential for everyday use, such as the Firefox web browser, LibreOffice, and GIMP image editor. There is also a Software Center where you can find and install additional applications.Another significant advantage of Linux Lite is its stability and security. The system is updated regularly, and there is a built-in firewall that adds extra protection to your laptop. Furthermore, the interface is simple and straightforward, which makes it easier to navigate and reduces the risk of errors or crashes.Linux Lite also has good hardware support, and most drivers are pre-installed. However, some proprietary drivers may need to be installed separately, depending on your hardware configuration.The system performance is impressive, even on low-end hardware. It boots up quickly and runs smoothly without any lag or delays. Additionally, it does not consume too much system resources, making it ideal for older laptops or computers with limited hardware specifications.In terms of customization, Linux Lite provides many themes and icon sets to choose from, and you can customize the desktop environment to your liking. There is also an option to install additional desktop environments if you prefer something different.Overall, Linux Lite is an excellent operating system for older laptops or computers with limited hardware specifications. It is user-friendly, stable, secure, and provides many pre-installed applications. It also has good hardware support and impressive system performance. I highly recommend Linux Lite to anyone looking for a lightweight, user-friendly, and stable operating system."

47,2023-03-09, Linux Lite, 6.2,10,1,"For the last few years I have been trying to switch to Linux for ideological reasons. I have done a bit of distro-hopping, to be honest every distro I tried seemed slower than Windows and buggy (Ubuntu, Mint were slow, Manjaro had way too many problems with my  ten years old Lenovo Thinkpad, MX flickered for some reason). I am a noob, I do not know how to solve the problems, I did a lot of research, at some point I just quit trying.Some days ago I decided to try again with Linux Lite. It installed without any problems. And then it just worked. Camera, wifi, microphone, graphics etc. In five minutes I was doing my job. It runs smoothly and seems polished. The only downside that I could find is that it takes a bit too long to boot. If you want something that just WORKS, choose Lite. All in all, an excellent distro."

I don't know why it's so slow installing from the live-usb. 4gb of ram is not inconsequential after all....and it's the same on a lLenovo T540P.Perhaps it's because I am installing a dual boot? and I insist on choosing the ext4 partition I have available for it? To be fair, this is pretty arcane and unhelpful in many similar distros but I would have to do some pretty intense study if I didn't have some kind of clue beforehand to figure out what's going on after the whirly-gig disk finally settles. You can waste a lot of time here. And i advise having an entertainment handy to while away the waiting.Another small peeve. Not everyone wants a Full Office Suite. It's like ripping wildroses out getting rid of it later.... I do get that Microsoft started the heavy lean to some sort of half-witted office environment (ie: ""folders"", 'files"",""recycle bins"") and ""Are You Sure You Want To Shut Down/Close/Delete "" but sometimes I think you might as well include a talking paperclip especially if paperclip told some good jokes while installation dragged on..."

We have a good selection of donated equipment for us to repurpose for the various new companies that we will be hosting. After deciding on a totally free Linux tier, we started with the installs.Linux Lite was by far the fastest of them all. But, there were a few major problems that has us decide on a major pass. On the laptops, not a single one, had working volume, brightness, etc. On all of the systems, (a mix of laptops, and desktops, a few newer miniforum cube pcs), not a single one could use a USB drive/thumb drive without jumping through hoops. Every other distro we tried just accomplished these things from the get-go. I really would have liked to use this, but having to fix issues like this on every donated piece of equipment would be way too overwhelming."

Pair this os with firefox and you've got a perfectly fine desktop machine. It has some decent themes the xcfe shows sometimes. my rating is 9 out of 10, very good operating system"
53,2023-01-05, Linux Lite, 6.2,8,7,"I must state first, that I am NOT any kind of an expert on OS's. I have just played with a few.This seems to be a very lean OS. It installs very quickly, because it only installs what they consider the basics.For example, it doe snot include Libre Office , nor could I find how to get Libre Office.As a long time user of MS Office, I feel I really need an Office program, and I feel Libre Office is an excellent replacement.I like the fact that this distro includes the CHROME web browser, as that is one I am very familiar with.All in all, if one does not need Libre Office, LITE is a great OS, being very lean and fast.It would be fine for browsing the WEB on an old computer, or small laptop.I THINK it would be fast, and a great OS on an old laptop."
54,2022-11-12, Linux Lite, 6.2,10,2,"Very nice and easy distroI've been using it since its first release and I've been a huge fan of it.I am waiting for your updates and new releases with impatience and I expect a lot from youI wish they had their own software center like UbuntuI also wish to add desktop interfaces like GNOME and KDEI also hope that the focus is not on weak devices, but rather take strong and modern devices into accountIn conclusion: I really like what you are doing and I expect that you will reach the first place soon.Best wishes"
55,2022-11-11, Linux Lite, 6.2,10,2,"I like very few Xfce distributions. The only other Xfce distributions that I have used and liked have been Manjaro's Xfce and MX Linux Xfce.Manjaro does an excellent job making Xfce look good and be very functional with one package manager that is superb. It's the best rolling release Xfce for me.MX Linux on the other side is the best Debian stable Xfce version with a plethora of tools to make it easy for a new user. It's fantastic.However, Linux Lite looks the best with the benefits of a solid Ubuntu/Debian base with some additional practical tools that make it easy to use for a new Linux user or seasoned Linux user. It makes Xfce look better and operate more smoothly I think. It does not have all the package options of MX Linux but it does not need them because of how they have arranged Synaptic Package Manager and their curated list of software. To me, a new user would be somewhat lost on MX Linux but not so with Linux Lite. Regardless, it's still good for an experienced Linux user because it is Linux with the terminal with an Xfce desktop environment.The best part of Linux Lite is the long term support base that is currently on Ubuntu's 22.04 LTS. It may not be the slimmest version of Xfce but for all the polish and functionality, it's a very ""lite"" operating system with the looks/abilities of heavier distribution that will do well on older hardware and especially newer systems. If you need a Linux operating system that is lighter on resources versus GNOME or KDE but is relatively fast on an older computer, Linux Lite is a good choice. Also, if you are new to Linux and need something that is easy to understand with a traditional desktop paradigm like on Windows, Linux Lite is up to the task."

58,2022-10-23, Linux Lite, 6.0,4,11,"Linux Lite is a good distro all around, however unless you are a native English speaker I just can't recommend it to most people comming from Windows or notWhile the menus have been translated more than previous versions, there is still a huge amount of ""spanglish"" in the menus and even in the welcome screen, where most of the text is still in English and it doesn't matter if you have European Spanish or Latin American Spanish, most of it is in EnglishEven system info is mostly in English, I'm sorry Linux Lite, yes I can have a good experience with it because I know English very well but that just isn't the reality in most spanish speaking countries and in that regard I think the way that Linux Lite presents itself as a good first choice for a distro can be a little bit misleading, not surprisingly it is not a very popular distro overall in the Spanish Linux communityWhich brings me to another point that while it doesn't bother me I understand why some people in the Spanish speaking Linux community are uncomfortable with it, it's minimum requirements and recommended specs, they are far too low spec for a distro that isn't that ""Lite"" anymore, again that wasn't a problem for me as I have two very decent PCs but my situation isn't that commonAnyway, I think overall the distro is fine but I wouldn't recommend it for a new Linux user, you are bettter with Mint, Ubuntu or even Manjaro as they are more polished and offer a similar and IMO better experience"

61,2022-10-01, Linux Lite, 6.0,9,11,"Perhaps the most underrated distro for ""newbies"" and beginners, Linux Lite names applications for their functions (""File Manager"" instead of ""Thunar,"" for example - excellent for beginners who wouldn't know that Thunar is a file manager and not Thor's hammer), has super-simple point-and-click GUI for cleaning, updating, and maintaining the OS in ""Lite Tweaks."" You can even clean systemd logs with a click!The default browser was chosen for it's universal appeal to users coming from Windows and Mac, but easily replaced. Snapd is disabled by default, which is great. But if you install Firefox using Lite Software, it activates snapd and installs Firefox as a snap! Noooooo thank you!

Many programs don't come in 32 bit anymore, so a slim linux was what I was looking for. The macOS for this computer won't support even an up to date browser, let alone software like Freetube.I'm amazed as to how smoothly things run under Linux Lite, although I don't have a comparison with other distros on that particular machine. I do know, however, that other distros usually need much more RAM and CPU power to run. (My MacBook Pro from 2010 with 16 GB is slow with Ubuntu, for example.) After boot-up, Linx Lite uses around 700 MB. Freetube let's me watch Youtube videos in 1080p without any problems smoothly, better than the last available macOS. So, I cannot confirm the slowliness problems that other users have with Linux Lite, however I have yet to try out the lates distro (6).

Checking boxes to get things sorted were ignored after applying them and video shearing while dragging open windows was very evident.

Or are they trying to minimize Linux know-it-alls that might infect their community - probably. Still I think their description kills it for a lot of us. At first it did for me:“lite...”  Sounds like something’s missing.“beginner friendly...”  Lost anyone who is not a beginner.“primarily targets Windows users…”  Lost Linux users and Windows haters.Then there are the reviewers rating it a 1 when they didn’t even get past the install. Don’t be fancy. Just click next, next, next, and you’re done. Also, not had a problem connecting to any copy machine or printer that’s on a network. Solutions are literally a Linux-Ubuntu-My-Issue web search away.I’d rather be right here with Lite feeling warm and fuzzy than fighting with Linux or using Microsoft. Unless I purposely want to have fun and break something - then all I need is the magic of Timeshift. So set that application up after the installer is done and it’ll bring you back from the dead every time.Anyone who wants a stable tool they can use with their eyes closed should try Lite. And when you hear complaints about Windows or Linux - yelling, “I want to pretend I’m free from these corporate models!” Give them Linux Lite!I’ve made customers, offices, friends, and Point Of Sales very happy running Linux Lite and normally just add Kingsoft WPS, and KDE Dolphin File Manager to work alongside Thunar. Hate me now. Love me later... Or not.xoxo (:"

It is my go to distro, just wish they could include more wifi drivers so less faff setting up wifi on certain network cards on a new install. Otherwise this is a great distro, and HP printer seems problematic no matter which linux distro is used, so cannot level fault at the linux lite team for that.

(My laptop includes a dual-core AMD A6-9225 with Radeon R4 that has a little lower end specs.) So far, I can say that I'm very pleased with this Linux distribution. I'm mostly praising Lite for its easy to navigate interface and classic, casual desktop experience with XFCE. I also wanted to switch to an Ubuntu-based distro and though I knew about this distro for a while, I never thought until a few days ago to switch to this after trying others.Pros:- Great for new Linux users.- Simple and stylish XFCE, the developers seemed to make this as polished as possible- Lightweight. I'm running about 500MB-600MB of RAM on idle.- System settings for XFCE seem more expanded since the developers added their own launchers within the setting manager to enchance the experience.-Configure everything for your system straight from the welcome screen.Cons:- Lots of pre-installed software. Comes with media player, GIMP, LibreOffice, (Impress, Calc, but not the whole program), maybe reconsider if you want absolute control over what is preinstalled. (or just uninstall all of it, which is what I did)To keep this more of a ""Lite-weight"" distribution, I would have left it up to the user to install whichever software they desire, but that's really my one and only complaint.Basically, Linux Lite is good for almost anyone of any experience and the developers paid a lot of attention to the UI to make it easy to use while keeping it good looking. Very satisfied overall!"

Tried a few other's that were supposed to be lite however many of them still have lots of background processes. In my case I'm using a Raspberry Pi 4 2GB RAM version. It ran so slow to a point where it was very annoying to use. Linux Lite works amazing on this device. I was actually surprised because I tried enough other ""lite"" distros that I thought maybe I underestimated the needs of my project. I was beginning to think I might have to settle. Or worse, spend more on hardware.I was also surprised that it includes features that made it feel somewhat like windows. That ism I wasn't expecting certain shortcut keys to work but out of habit executed them anyway to find the OS responded as I expected. Again, surprising because it's snappy considering the low RAM. My Desktop has 32GB of RAM and Windows uses more than 5GB of RAM at idle. Granted there is a lot more going on behind the scenes but a good portion of that is used to make the OS ""snappy"" so the fact that you managed to preserve snappyness with such a low amount of RAM is amazing.There are still a few things installed that I could live without considering it's a lite distro, However at least those were only taking up storage space. Not processor power. Most of which were easy enough to remove or so small as to be negligible. Mainly that's an issue for reasons that are specific to my project.

111,2021-06-30, Nitrux, 2021.06.29,10,6,"Nitrux is the Linux distro of the future... or from one possible future. Everything you've heard of, regarding latest Linux technologies and trends, is there: Wayland, containerized apps (through AppImage and flatpak), crossplatform desktop applications (through MauiKit (not to be confused with the similarly albeit unrelated .NET MAUI)), zsh by default, etc. The design and user interface of the modified-KDE desktop is on a completely different league that anything you've seen, with only late Unity and Budgie coming close in terms of integration, efficiency, elegance and intuitiveness.That being said, it is simply too unstable to be usable for any real work. Even something as simple as a apt update upgrade will, more often than not, send your working system through the toilet. Wayland is a mess to configure: it took me more than an hour, and a lot of digging on obscure Reddit threads, to configure something as fundamental as tap-to-click on the laptop I tested it on (though this is fault of Wayland and not so much of Nitrux itself). If you want to glimpse the future, or one possible future, of Linux in the desktop, try it by all means, I cannot recommend it hard enough for that purpose, and evaluate it within such context; but do not try to use it as a daily driver. Some suggestions if you do decide to give it a shot:- I cannot speak of hardware recognition, at least not regarding proprietary stuff such as NVIDIA, though I must say my wireless got recognized without problems (something MX Linux struggled a bit with)- Do not attempt to perform a system update/upgrade... Other than that, everything is fine. The system is fast and responsive, even in the 13 y.o. Core 2, 4gig ram, laptop I'm trying it on. Take it as a proof of concept, to toy around newer trends, not for critical stuff, and everything will be fine."

Additionally, Vmetal... The holy grail of emulation. there has been no talk sense 2019 and any mention of how to make it work(found a page on facebook that redirects to the main page and nothing about vmetal) has been scrubbed. I wholeheartidly dont reccomend this distro as it is very manipulative. They do the BTRFS and appimage idea is great. everything else is extremely sketch"
113,2021-05-10, Nitrux, 2021.05.01,10,40,"Interesting distribution, because Vmetal works and with very good performance, but it doesn't work with hybrid cards for laptops, which is my case. Very good performance, but I don't like KDE Plasma, I prefer Cinnamon or Gnome. It would be great if Vmetal works like Parallels on macOS because many people like me need to provide support for clients or work with platforms that don't work very well in Wine. I highly recommend it to anyone who has a Desktop and needs Windows running parallel to linux in real time for several applications including games without having to restart in a dual boot."

Just installed the latest OpenIndiana Hipster on my Thinkstation p520 with nvidia p1000: everything works right out of the box. Surprisingly, basic desktop apps are up to date: at the time of writing Firefox is 115.0.2, Thunderbird is 102.13, python is 3.10.12 and Libreoffice is 7.5.4.2. The Hipster repo has ~1K packages, while pkgsrc has >25K available.ZFS and boot environments give trouble-free updates (I mean it!); virtualization support is first class with zones (aka containers), which are baked into the system. I think OI is mostly an OS for servers/workstations although it can certainly be profitably used for desktops, with several limitations in terms of apps availability (eg, I haven't checked a/v capabilities). OI is based on illumos, which is itself the open source descendant of Solaris (aka SunOS). Both OI and illumos are actively developed. If your hardware is compatible give it a go. OI is a 'proper' Unix, enterprise system: it enables you to get your stuff done with little fuss.Of course, I am writing this review from Firefox on OI!"
116,2023-07-21, OpenIndiana, 2022.10,10,7,"OpenIndiana is great if you had some experience with Solaris, want to avoid systemd, like using the MATE desktop environment, and have compatible hardware to install it on. So for me this OS is a 10/10. If it didn't exist, I would probably be using Devuan if I needed Debian packages or Artix if I wanted Arch rolling release...It installed and worked with everything on a ThinkPad T530. It worked on a Dell Latitude D630 except for the Broadcom wireless card which had no driver. Users with Intel integrated graphics or NVIDIA GPU, Intel wireless, and slightly older hardware will have a higher chance of successful installation.You can boot from live disc, do a graphical install, and have a working system with MATE desktop very quickly. NVIDIA driver 470.x is installed so GTX 6xx and newer work. Don't bother running Firefox or Thunderbird while booting from the live install disc, they will crash but run fine afterwards on the installed system.Postinstall, I ran 'sudo pkg update' to get all the latest packages. OI nicely creates a clone after every update (maybe because of ZFS) so you can boot from the previous environment if needed. You can run 'sudo pkg uninstall firefox' and 'sudo pkg install librewolf' as I did. Also installed libreoffice, claws-mail, gimp, wine, etc. just as easily. Everything I need was in the repo."
117,2023-03-06, OpenIndiana, 2022.10,8,3,"After some small problems with this update the OI systems runs fine and rock solid. I don't use MATE, but the ctwm instead, which makes the system slightly faster.Together with the pkgin-framework I have all the applications I need. It's a nice alternative Unix system, however newer versions for Firefox would make live easier. Unfortunately OI is a little bit exotic system and the nummber of acive programmers may be limited. Nevertheless I hope it will have a long life and a good future. For me using OI is not a waste of time, I have learned a lot about Unix/Solaris and still have much fun."

Some of the applications are slightly behind current releases, but given the GNU toolchain and userland, you can compile and update these quite easily. Overall, it's a pretty good system and a definite competitor for replacing Linux on my desktop. I will note, that it is not as fast to boot or shutdown as an equivalent system, although I've found this to be true of most Unix systems."

And calling the release ""hipster""... I rolled my eyes, no one... NO ONE has any positive associations with anything related to hipsters. All of this especially coming from an OS with a great name such as Solaris.

I personally find this distro stable reliable and fairly polished. Based on Xubuntu 22.04 it provides the reliability that ubuntu is known for and the ease that xfce and lxde are based upon. the plank makes a nice alternative to the xfce or the lxde panel but we still have the options included with the xfce toolbar above. it has a nice Macish appearance and even though it uses thunar for the file browser it has the MacOS skin over it.

Well...so over the last few weeks I tried 22 different distros.  SlizTaz is the one I really, really wanted to work and was the only one I could not get WiFi to work on.   What i think is going on is it does not recognize my WiFi hardware unlike 21 other distros. Unfortunately there are many SlizTaz documents for setting up WiFi,meant for various SlizTaz versions that,in general, are not identified.  Several of the terminal commands either do not exist, the parameters have changed,or the scripts the run with were not updated.  For example one doc instructs you to issues the following:+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ lspci | grep -i network+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++good except in the version I am in running it tells you the flags are -k and -m and it does not recognize -iThe docs also note this:+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++SliTaz-4.0 and newer:wifi-box was renamed to wifibox+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Nope, I was running rolling and it is wifi-boxand then there is this:+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++The following commands do all of the above steps. This is also the easiest way:# tazhw detect-pci --get-firmware# /etc/init.d/network.sh restart++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++when the commands are run, it does not find things, fail on restart and indicates errors.So the issue is the documentation is not in sync with the versions, even the doc with the installation does not match the distro.  I am sure a Linux administrator who had seen what WiFi cards look like and new what drivers are needed and how to install them could adroitly navigate my issue; but sadly that does not (yet) describe me.  I am reliant on the documentation which seems not to match the current version.  All that being said, I love the desktop, the blazing speed, I really want to get this working,I also note the kernel is very dated and in the forum their seems to be some debate about the future of the distro. IMO, it would be a shame if SliTaz disappears.    This is a nice distro, in a narrow niche where it is sorely needed.   So how to rate it, for a Linux system  admin with experience this is likely a 9.0,   For someone not afraid of a command line but is not  a hard core Linux admin this is likely a 7.0 due to the documentation.   For someone who is a GUI type with limited command line experience this is likely 5.0 .   So I averaged the scores,and for now call SlizTaz a 7.0In the end it is a great distro that simply needs a little attention.   If I can get the WiFi configured and use it for some time I'll likely see if I can help them organize the docs.tfb"

Quite effortless I may say, apart from the rather slow install and lengthy update process afterwards.While I can totally relate to how this is a perfect distro in an educational environment, it still offered me some problems. For some reason, it would not mount ntfs partitions. I chose the workstation install but found out that there was still a lot of tweaking and installing to do. The software center is rather scarsely populated so you need to go by other repositories. If you are not willing to get your hands dirty then you might have to pass on things like VLC, to name just one example. So, OK, I could get my work done using Springdale but overall the distro looks far from trendy. Out of the box choices are few. minus points: rather dated, few applications out of the box, needs tweaking to suit your tasteon the positive side: it is a solid base to built a more customized system, clean and fast"

The speed apart even on an ancient Samsung RV415 is amazing. Using the net installer and selecting KDE gives you a KDE4 system with all the things we lost when this ‘upgraded’ to Plasma5. There simply isn’t a better looking or more configurable desktop weather app that YAWP and the system monitor too is far better than the ‘new’ Plasma5 equivalent. Plus you can mix theme components such as having a Phoenix analog clock with the Blue Sora main theme, none of which you can do with Plasma5. Font changes migrate into your whole system instead of leaving bits of it unchanged. I’ve now got this installed into 5 very different hardware systems and none of them have given a moments trouble. Just make sure to enable the two additional repos listed on their site. Even so you will likely need some .rpm packages plus maybe one or two of their dependencies as separate downloads that aren’t available using a straightforward ‘yum install’. Most of these are available as CentOS packages. I needed packages or additional components for some games, qBittorrent, Gnumeric, Roboto fonts and GkrellM plus ‘ntfsprogs’ so my Seagate external drive would mount. balenaEtcher has it’s own repo and that was it for me. Saved all these to a folder for use on other machines and adding all these extras took less than 10 minutes. This is truly a system for people who prefer to work with it rather than play with it although there’s nothing wrong with distro hopping if that’s what you like to do. Just set and forget with years of support still ahead. So many people still calling this a CentOS clone whereas it’s a custom Red Hat based distro and was out long before CentOS was dreamed up.

I used for my first time and loved.Very simple to use responsive and fast.I used with ventoy directly installed on my HDU backup and worked like a charm.What I most loved is its simplicity and its interface with no frills. It does what it claims.In my opinion the overall system might be improved by adding two things: a battery monitor in the application bar and foreign Language support.I am currently checking RedoRescue in comparison with Rescuezilla, but so far I prefer it despite other is more supported and have more applications included."
145,2022-12-11, Redo Rescue, 4.0.0,10,1,"Easy to use and work as advertised. Other backup systems have too many confusing options for someone like my grand parents to navigate.  Redo Rescue is a snap even for beginner and can put everything back quickly if there is a problem.I also like that the cd has built in tools like gParted for making partition changes after the backup is restored, a web browser, and more. Even though it is not intended to be a live cd desktop operating system it has a lot of the same features of a good live cd linux distrobution."
146,2021-10-13, Redo Rescue, 3.0.2,5,1,"I like what this project does, and the updates are great. However, here we are a year after the 3.0 version and nothing has changed other than the underlying Debian OS. It doesn't exactly give me the warm fuzzy feeling, especially since the developer has disappeared with total radio silence once before. At this point, I'm going to stick with CloneZilla and RescueZilla. They both get more frequent releases and have been proven to work well for my needs."
147,2021-08-19, Redo Rescue, 3.0.2,10,2,"1) This little gem creates a full snapshot of your existing system with high compression and super fast!2) You need 2 USB drives - one small drive with boot ISO and one larger one to store the images.3) It automatically copies both the IFE (grub/FAT) partition and the main EXT4 partition into a single file4) It trims the fat - only data is copied. My 256Gb NVme drive with Debian 11 + the usual apps was compressed to 9.2Gb - took about 2-3 minutes5) It can restore the snapshot of a 256Gb drive on a larger drive e.g. 500Gb and leaves the spare space you can format for extra data.6) Nice, easy to understand and navigate GUII was using it to create consecutive snapshots of my tweaked-out Sparky Linux 6.0Love it !   10/10"
148,2021-04-11, Redo Rescue, 3.0.2,10,2,"Redo was able to back up my data from two partitions on Ubuntu Linux at 3GB / sec. The restore also went easily, everything works fine. The design features a nice, simple interface."
149,2021-01-11, Redo Rescue, 3.0.2,10,3,"Absolutely reliabale on my Asus- and HP-Notebooks. I'm having W10 and Mint Cinnamon  respectively W7 and Ubuntu 16.04/20.04 on the Notebooks and since I try a lot of prgrams it's quite comfortable to have working images of all OS-partitions.Version 3.02 works on both i386 and x64.I used version 1.04 before without problems but only on i386 pc's. It also wörked fine for me.Saving 7 partitions (boot, MS reserved, W10, W10 recovery, Swap, Linux/ and Linux Home) with all my usual programs installed take about 24 min.I'm absolutely happy with REDO and it replaced Macrium Reflect for me as that was the only programm that could do reliable images of Win and Linux.I start REDO from SD-card although it is booting faster from USB.

I tried the 12 Alpha version and found it very good, however the Edge browser was not opening. I installed Chrome but it didn't open either. So I downloaded the Beta 12 version and this issue was resolved well and everything worked perfectly. I installed the distro in multiboot with Windows and Linux Mint and it is running fine on my old comp. Compaq 6000 PRO Intel 3Ghz. The installations of the programs that I use the most, through the software store and via the terminal, were performed without any problems. The distro is very stable, lightweight and fast. Congratulations to the developers for the excellent work. I recommend people try Linspire 12 Public Beta 1.

151,2023-05-04, Slint, 15.0,10,2,"
Slint is a very interesting distribution as it adds extra functionality for blind people. The website is very useful and informative. It is slightly easier to use compared to Slackware. The installer is very intuitive and comes with a good choice of desktop environments, mate, lxqt... perhaps xfce in the future. It comes with a good set of tools for system and software management and is a ready to use distribution. I find the system to be very stable and with very up-to-date software. The only negative point has to do with the customization/look of the system because I find it a bit standard.

Great distro overall, just like arch without non-free software and includes 32-bit support, The only real problem you will encounter will be installation media, do not, i repeat do not use iso's published on the website they're outdated by over a year, on rolling release that's ancient, for your sanity do a quick arch/artix installation and migrate as quickly as possible. It's not a good distro for a beginer, you will encounter problems along the way (just like with arch, that's expected). I recommend this distro for anyone with supported hardware (as it obviously dosen't use non-free drivers) and with basic GNU/Linux knowledge."
153,2022-09-27, Parabola GNU/Linux-libre, 2021.08.11,10,4,"If you love Arch but are concerned for your software freedom, this distro is excellent. It prevents you from accidentally installing nonfree software by checking for conflicts with the conveniently named package ""your-freedom"". It may be a slight inconvenience to set up the keyrings, yet that should not be problematic for someone who enjoys Arch. Apart from warning you about nonfree packages, there are no further restrictions. It does not truly prevent you from installing nonfree software, but it gives you a nice heads up."
154,2021-10-08, Parabola GNU/Linux-libre, 2020.01.18,10,4,"It's pretty much indistinguishable from arch, meaning all the arch wiki documentation and support is applicable. Parabola wiki also has detailed instructions for librebooting with fully encrypted drive, including /boot. "

The problem is in the iso images that come with a graphical environment. These images have many bugs and problems after installing the system, but when parabola with systemd is installed in the same way as Arch Linux, following the Parabola guide, the system is perfect. It's the lightest, cleanest and fastest distro I've ever used, the best for older notebooks. Thank you Parabola team."

I was caught up in the hype, and was expecting better than Manjaro but NO. Easy and nice installer, but after that it was downhill.I was expecting fast but no it was pretty ordinary, Q40S is faster. It does have a large collection of programs, once you set it up correctly GUI(Manjaro is all set to go out of the box). I learned a valuable lesson about hype, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. It is not bad, it just does not rise to the level of the hype that had been surrounding it."
158,2023-07-19, EndeavourOS, 03-2023,1,0,"It doesn't feel comfortable. I have been using Manjaro since 2018. Now that I've bought a new SSD, I wanted to go on a distribution safari again, among other things I took a close look at the successor to Antergos. I don't remember Antergos calling itself a terminal-centric distro.An operating system that you have in daily use should be user-friendly. EndeavorOS is now more Arch than user friendly.I've also used pure Arch Linux, but even there everything worked great after hours of setting up. EndeavorOS, on the other hand, is still making my life difficult after 3 months. My everyday life consists of gaming and software development. Which worked perfectly on Manjaro as well as on Arch Linux. EndeavorOS, on the other hand, prevents me from mastering my everyday life as smoothly as usual."
159,2023-07-15, EndeavourOS, 03-2023,10,0,"Simply perfect!Best linux distro based on arch - nothing beats it on desktop.Using it on laptops and desktop sytems; huge availability of software and really easy to use.Nice community and good support - this is how a free distro really is meant to be.Would definitively recommend if you have some basic technical skills.Personally I'm using KDE as desktop environment.... make it look like YOU want.Win11, MacOS, your own choices... you simply can do it.Using timeshift and btrfs allows always to revert to the previous system version - awesome!"
160,2023-06-30, EndeavourOS, 03-2023,10,0,"EndeavourOS with GNOME, installed on my 10-year-old Intel Core i5-3230M laptop with 6GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD using the Btrfs file system, has proven to be an exceptional Linux distribution choice that is Arch-based. Despite the age of my hardware, the performance remains surprisingly smooth and responsive.The GNOME desktop environment offers a sleek and modern interface, emphasizing simplicity and productivity. Its clean layout, featuring a top bar housing the system menu, calendar, and notification center, ensures an organized workspace. The Activities overview allows for seamless multitasking, making it effortless to switch between applications.What sets EndeavourOS apart is its hassle-free installation process, which supports the Btrfs file system. This advanced file system offers benefits such as snapshot capabilities, allowing you to create system backups and easily roll back any changes if needed. The integration of Btrfs with EndeavourOS ensures improved system stability and data integrity, providing peace of mind while using your laptop.The distribution's lightweight nature and optimized performance shine through in everyday tasks. Whether I'm browsing the web, editing documents, or managing files, EndeavourOS handles these activities with ease. Additionally, the Pacman package manager, known for its speed and efficiency, simplifies software installation and updates.Another standout aspect of EndeavourOS is its strong community support. The forums and online resources offer a wealth of helpful guides and a vibrant community ready to assist with any questions or issues that may arise. This active community fosters a sense of camaraderie, making troubleshooting an enjoyable experience.In summary, EndeavourOS with GNOME, installed using the Btrfs file system, is an outstanding choice for older hardware. It delivers a polished and efficient Linux experience, with its performance, simplicity, and integration of advanced features like Btrfs snapshots. Combined with the robust community support, EndeavourOS ensures a reliable and user-friendly operating system for your laptop."
161,2023-06-25, EndeavourOS, 03-2023,2,0,"I wanted to try EndeavourOS because it was number 2 on the Distro Watch hit list.  I thought the top 3 would be good.  I already have MX Linux and Mint.  I am not new to Linux.  I’ve been using it since April 9, 2014. The On-line installer is good.  I wanted MATE desktop.  I got to have Caja file manager.  I was able to make an encrypted partition to install it on.  It installs all of it on that partition.After the install, needed to use the boot menu to get to it.  Then immediately it comes up with the passphrase prompt.  Then it says attempting to decrypt.  Sits there for about 20 seconds. The grub menu only will work on EndeavourOS alone.  I don’t mind using the boot menu to get to it.  The other 2 distros installed come up on my default distro on boot up grub prompt.I put it on a 2022 Think Penguin Pro11 with a dodecacore CPU and 16 gig of Ram.  It should boot up fast.I was able to decrypt the partition from other the other distros just like any encrypted partition which is good, in case the boot up to that distro fails for some reasonI like that it doesn’t have very many applications preinstalled, and you can put on it what you want.  But It’s not easy to do.I was able to use the yay in terminal to install a GUI package managers.  I got Pamac.  Then I wanted to install also Octopi.  But it didn’t come up on Pamac.  So used yay to install that.  It took a while and it asks some tough questions on yay.  Got it to work after a couple of tries.  Pamac looks like Mint’s software manager.   It looked like it put on an updater with it that on startup it checks for updates.  Octopi is like Synaptic.  MATE Desktop on this distro, as well as all the Debian based distros I tried, the desktop appearance theme won’t work on some applications, like VLC media player.I also could not find the Mate Advanced Menu (MATE-Menu) on the package managers.  I found it on the search that comes up on the internet browser of  AUR packages.  I could only get a tar.gz file, and I don’t know how to install them.  So  EndeavourOS Arch won’t work for me.  I don’t know how it got up there in the hit list.It looks sort of like MX Linux.  Get MX Linux instead.  MX Linux has a lot of useful things pre-installed.  It’s easier to use.Mint MATE works better.  But Mint encryption no longer works on the home folder.  Only encryption option is the encrypt the whole drive, I think.Of course I already have MX Linux and Mint, so I won’t have to work on them anymore."
162,2023-06-24, EndeavourOS, 03-2023,10,20,"I love this distro. It's Arch Linux but with so many QoL features and improvements, whilst also using Calamares for the installer. There was no hassle installing and my NVIDIA gpu had working audio because they don't use nouveau. I use the XFCE desktop with it and it's really awesome. The Welcome app is really useful along with the Quickstart Installer they have bundled. Plus you can easily update your mirrors to switch to whatever is the fastest for you.

My current preference is for Arch-based distributions, I also have Fedora, Suse, and Ubuntu (Mint 21) installations.My EndeavourOS is on a Lenovo, Ryzen 5, convertible laptop. Last year Arch updates broke touchpad and touchscreen support. Querying EOS support lead to the developers and back to the linux source-code. My best alternative was an external mouse until the issues were corrected earlier this year. (It seems like the source had to be modified to detect specific manufacturer/model and apply the correction). Recently, I have had to fallback and update about half the time because boot hangs at a display brightness setting ---- ""waiting..."". I suspect this is also a Lenovo/Ryzen issue.I haven't seen these issues on another Lenovo, Intel CPU convertible.I think EOS is the easiest Arch distro to install and maintain, with the caveat that ""buyer beware"" if you're running a Ryzen laptop."

165,2023-05-18, EndeavourOS, 03-2023,9,11,"I have to say that I am very impressed with the efforts of the development team at Endeavour.  Very nice looking and had this installed before, as xfce.  This was because the installation program takes so long to connect to a server so you can have an option to install an alternative desktop environment.  Wasn't sure if there was something wrong with the program or if my internet was down.  After requesting to install ""online"" vs ""offline"" several times, the installer finally came up.During the install, you may want to launch a disk partitioning tool first.  Some distros will not allow the installer to erase the previous partition so manually deleting is necessary.  Now the installer gave the option to use the whole disk and created the required partitions and the rest of the install went well.Blue tooth would not work and it is turned off by default.  The endeavour website has a simple command to enter to get it running but it requires that you reboot after entering the command in the ""terminal"".Thanks again for this great distro and hopefully more development will get some of these things fixed.  For example, selecting blue tooth ""on"" during install would be nice.  Another thing I would like to see is a note to the person installing that ""Connection may take awhile to complete"" or maybe even showing the result of connection to the server or not.  I am running the Gnome desktop."

It initially appealed to me as an alternative to Manjaro in the hope that I might get more than a few weeks or months go by without encountering issues fixed by a rollback or reinstall, but I was shown to be wrong. EndeavourOS too has occasional glitches following updates, and although these seem to occur less frequently than with Manjaro, resorting to a rollback or reinstall are also a part of the experience. That's not to say that a broken EndeavourOS cannot be fixed if one is prepared to spend the time researching and trialing and failing and etc etc but in my case time is a precious resource combined with less patience than most. It looks good, it's slick and fast but ultimately, like other Arch based distros, not suitable as a daily driver if your living depends on it."

Rolling distro means in theory I never need to rebuild the operating systems again. For the 2013 iMac, it prolongs its lifespan indefinitely, and I don't have to resort to hacky bootloaders any more to run the latest MacOS. Apple may consider a Quad Core i7-4771 with an SSD, Nvidia Graphics, and 32GB or RAM 'obsolete', but I certainly don't. 2. Latest kernel and packages means frankly a better experience then a more static distro like a Debian-based or Red Hat-based distro. I was finding myself frustrated with dated applications on Linux Mint. 3. I have not identified a single application yet that was not available on the AUR. And that even included some left-field stuff like YNAB 4 (which is technically a Windows application!) 4. It runs a remarkable portion of my Windows Steam library thanks to Proton. And most of my favorite games have a native Linux port too. 5. It is helping me break my reliance on the Apple ecosystem. 6. The online wikis and other doco has been super helpful. 7. So basically Endeavour combines the poweruser/developer vibe of MacOS with enough gaming functionality of Windows but with indefinite security updates for the lifetime of the hardware. What's not to like? I've found a few niggles with some of the suspend/resume functionality on the iMac, but nothing I haven't been able to resolve with a few tweaks. Ironically the only games that are not working well are some turn-based strategy games. I can probably run these in a Windows 10 Guest VM.I miss some of the MacOS party tricks like iMessages, Continuity, Handoff, and Unlock with Apple Watch but my bank account will thank me long term. I'm clear-eyed that running bleeding-edge Linux in the form of an Arch distro comes with some risks, but I have my TimeShift snapshots running, and I am confident that I can overcome any dramas. I've really tweaked both machines to my liking. I'm seriously thinking of getting rid of MacOS on my Macbook Pro too. On my Core 2 Duo, which is basically a throwaway laptop at this point, I have found that Endeavour/Arch is easily outperforming Linux Mint in real world use.

179,2023-03-20, EndeavourOS, 03-2023,9,0,"Replaced the Manjaro distro.Tested with i3wm on 2 desktop(Dell) and one laptop(HP).It correctly detected time zone and keyboard layout.No boot issue or drive incompatibility with the last kernel drivers (except for the HP fingerprint).Stable.Just the minimal necessary software pre-installed but with adequate basic development tools.(I didn't had to manually clean up the unwanted installed sw and install the basic development tools as I used to before).Conclusion: Both EndeavourOS and Manjaro are good Arch based distros, but I would recommend EndeavoursOS for sw developers."
180,2023-03-16, EndeavourOS, 03-2023,10,3,"A really great distribution!1. Incredibly stable (you will forget about Manjaro bugs once and for all)2. Nothing extra (No shitty Manjaro settings)3. With the environment, KDE becomes a candy. Especially with the KDE Framework on top.4. Graphical installer with environment selection.5. Based on Arch Linux (AUR repositories are the best that can be).6. ""yay"" out of the box (very convenient).7. You can update the system using a shortcut and it will show which packages you have any which versions they will update to.Thanks to the developer!"
181,2023-03-15, EndeavourOS, 03-2023,9,1,"HOW LONG CAN THEY KEEP IT UP?Indeed, this is for my endeavor. (I was raised on American, not British English, sorry only the name of the British ship and this distro would get the extra vowel LOL.) Before 2022 I knew absolutely nothing about Arch Linux and the distros based on it. It has succeeded taking Arch Linux to a new level, broader appeal, a bright (near) future. This one obviously gained my interest, like many other people visiting Distrowatch enough times._right_ _now_ this is the OS that could be most easily installed which has the latest KDE Plasma v5.27. Even on a 10-year-old portable computer like mine with Intel Sandy Bridge CPU, ""only"" 2-core CPU and ""only"" 4GB RAM. I have installed this distro twice. In fact I have done so a grand total of 10 times! Started with ""Artemis Nova"" (it was in August last year, now I don't remember, it was the penultimate for that series), first tried it with XFCE but felt I couldn't keep it around, wanted to avoid rolling-release other than Fedora at the time. That was foolish but I made up for it. Then I did something a bit more foolish, as soon as ""Cassini"" came out I took off XFCE for KDE. Later I hunted down the two-month-old ""Artemis Neo"" ISO because I liked the look for XFCE better and, of course, installed it offline. I also have it with LXQt.In the latest try the ""Cassini Neo"" ISO was almost three months old, a few days before it was updated, I was able to successfully install online with KDE. I cannot say this about at least two or three others I've tried. One was great also but bloated. Another is very lame about its ""implementation"" of Wine, fixed one thing while breaking another. Tried still another but the alternative package manager is a real loser.An user will be put off if he/she wants to try this OS with a desktop/W.M. other than XFCE -- certainly elementary OS couldn't be presented in this way. Also note that the Budgie setup is different from the screenshots for Solus and a few other places, and whatever based on GNOME, in case the user wants to get that D.E. for the first time. To me it acts and looks too much like XFCE, stop confounding people like this. For starters, panel at bottom instead of at top and date/time on lower-right.EndeavourOS tries not to be bloatware but some people might be put off by stuff steered a bit toward developers. This helps keep the initial installation lightweight. It starts and finishes fast, but better on non-mechanical disk. The update notifier might be annoying when it pops up ""suddenly"" while somebody is trying to do something while Internet isn't turned on. Must make the crucial choice at installation for bootloader. I've found ""systemd-boot"" might require a strong backup solution.Yes I am a member of the forum so this review might be a bit biased. But this only comes from experience, why lie about a great thing going? I would recommend this distro even to a total Linux beginner. ""Terminal centric?"" don't be put off by it, the ""Welcome"" application is that awesome, never have to see a terminal because of it...That said, be forewarned that doing system update through the ""Welcome"" app requires ""root"" password if it was set. If the user prefers to use the password for his/her regular account, must do the update in the old-fashioned way. This is the case for a few other things, for example to acquire the EndeavourOS wallpapers.Almost forgot to mention that the user who expects to use Wine for music creation might want to install ""lib32-portaudio"". Without it OpenMPT fails to show the ""WASAPI"" audio driver options and produces no sound. I don't know any other workaround.by mnrv-ovrf-year-c"

It isn't beginner level easy with lots of command line work. Once installed Plasma looks and works slick. The Arch repositories have good software with some of the latest packages.I was having problems with Wayland conflicts on other distros but with this defaults to x11.

It gives you the choice of file system, unlike Garuda. Everything just works. It looks great, it runs smooth. All my graphics and multi monitor setup has worked fine after resuming from sleep, unlike other distros I've tried. It really is seamless.

I have never seen such a thing anywhere. Maybe this is of course the problem of arch linux in general, I love arch, but I no longer have any patience to poke around in it. It's like buying an old crumbling car - you constantly have to fix something."
205,2022-11-27, EndeavourOS, 22.6,9,54,"TLDR: It's Arch so it has everything. For an Arch distro, EndeavorOS is amazingly stable -- as long as you're comfortable(not an expert) with the command line.A friend recently put Endeavor on his desktop and was raving about the speed and stability, so I decided to follow suite. I've never attempted to install Vanilla Arch, so I can't draw apple-to-apple comparisons, but Endeavor's installation is very user friendly. I love the online install aspect which allows you to choose your DE at the last minute. I chose Plasma, btw. After the installation, the Welcome app takes you through initial updates and installing common/popular applications. Speaking of installation, I will say 1 negative about the Endeavor installation is that Grub did not index my Windows boot manager (on a separate SSD) like every other installation I've done on this system. In order to access Windows, I have to choose it at UEFI boot. Not a deal killer... I could probably update grub, but just something to note if you still rely on Windows. Another negative is that, at least with full disk encryption, the boot time is a bit longer than some of the other distro's I've used. So far, Fedora seems to be the fastest -- with encrypted disk.Now, Endeavor calls itself a ""terminal-centric"" distro because it does not ship a gui package manager/software store. I have, historically, preferred the CLI for package management, so this doesn't bother me. For those that are bothered, you can install Pamac or Octopi if you'd like - I'd recommend you get used to the CLI. I've been able to install and configure all my applications using pacman and yay. I eventually switched out yay for paru which has a tighter integration with pacman. I've been gaming successfully, though I'm unable to run Splitgate in native mode. I believe that is more specific to my AMD GPU than to EndeavorOS. There is 1 slight annoyance in that I'm having trouble getting the weather plasmoids to work, but I also haven't dug into them very deep. I'm really stretching here to find negatives to talk about.As a guy who has traditionally feared Arch, EndeavorOS has made me a believer. I realize that Arch has a tendency to break due to bleeding edge updates so I've protected myself. I setup Timeshift and installed the timeshift-autosnap script from the AUR. I take updates 2 to 3 times a week and it's been smooth sailing! I gave 9 out of 10 simply because there's always room for improvement."

Also love the fact that there's no need to wait every stable update to upgrade whole system, and it just works after the upgrade. Nothing buggy so far in kde desktop so i wanted to say thanks for this distro.

N00b review, home user. Background is owning a Linux-based VDSL2 modem/router/wifi box which is no longer receiving updates.My goal was to dumb/split down that thingy into two separate entities, namely a dumb DSL modem for IPfire RED side (aka public interwebs), and a simple ethernet+wifi switch which talks to IPfire on the GREEN side, what with ipfire keeping pub and private separate.Lo and behold, ipfire pretty much worked out of the box, and compared to the firewall in my older combo box, the interface felt friggin' user *friendly*! Samba add-on made it easy enough to turn ipfire into a poor man's home NAS. Enabled SSH server, went rogue in the CLI and now the damn thing is a full bitcoin node as well.Long story short, this is what I tried to do with barebones Debian but did not know how... so much stuff in this distro which just manages to demystify swamp monster... er, interwebs... a little, for a n00b.I love that this is an independent distro with some specific goals, with carefully chosen options (PAKfire) afaict. Me likee!"
208,2023-03-04, IPFire, 2.27-core173,10,0,"This is a very nice system for building your own firewall. I got a new ISP and they shipped an awful locked-down Amazon unit that needed a bluetooth-enabled smartphone to talk to it so I wanted something else. Commercial stuff is expensive, and you want to be sure to get security updates. I tried OpnSense but the lack of decent wireless support on BSD was no good for me, I don't want to have a separate access point.This is easy to install and configure, I used an old SFF office computer I rescued from the trash, with a second NIC installed. A decent WiFi dongle allows it to run as an AP as well, but make sure the device you choose supports AP mode. The forum and Wiki are great, and the developers respond promptly to questions. IPFire uses few system resources and has some excellent features such as the Intrusion Prevention system. There are also lots of logging options to see what's happening. My system has been running for over a year now, only rebooted for system updates."
209,2022-02-27, IPFire, 2.27-core163,9,17,"I am a former Freesco user and when it became hard to source hardware, I switched. I tried pfSense, and whilst I was impressed with what you can do, it really doesn't play nice with some hardware. Based on FreeBSD, it is less in tune with some consumer grade stuff. IpFire was next and being a Linux based firewall, it handles consumer stuff much better, yielding more reliability in my situation.Overall config is easy, forum support is good, helpful, feature set from a security perspective very impressive. I managed to hook up my UPS easily, configure RED to the right VLAN, and get SSH setup securely. Recently I've moved the hardware to a simple appliance, and that combo works so well, I have literally all the services up and running. I like the ease of setting your own DNS servers, avoiding those the ISP provides and switching to secure DNS. OpenVPN is easy to set up and get going, and the DynamicDNS feature works well, it automatically maintains the assigned IP for you, allowing you easily connect from the outside. Reporting is good, lots of info. I handle around 30-50TB every day, and it is rock solid. I have it reboot occasionally to clear the cache, but it's not really needed. Updates are frequent and useful, and have been for years. I've made several donations over the years to support the effort.Probably it's biggest weakness is something pfSense and OPNSense can do, the routing part. There is some VLAN support, but if your ISP uses multiple RED's (or external networks in non IPFire speak), IpFire can't handle it, there is also not much in IPv6 support. Supposedly there is rewrite on the way supporting IPv6, but this is not a wealthy community, so progress is slow. So for most SOHO scenarios, IpFire is great, but it might not be enough for your needs. It is true open source, well maintained by a group that knows what they are doing. The other Linux based offerings seem more the fremium model, even though they blab open source, their power has to be unlocked through payments. I would never go that route, so if IpFire can't do it for me, I'd go to pfSense, or OPNSense. So in my mind, IpFire is the best Linux based open source firewall distro out there. And that's quite something. "
210,2022-01-06, IPFire, 2.27-core162,10,3,I use Ipfire for a while now. I tried many firewall but i always prefer ipfire. The best feature i love is geolocation block. So i can block all incoming trafics from the country i blocked.

At that point, I'll have to roll out another solution, such as ShoreWall, on a systemd- free distribution, such as Devuan.For those who are unconcerned about the systemd intent, IPFire is a great long- term solution, particularly if one stays current with updates.Excelent documentation, attention to detail and user problems.  Highly recommended!"

Almost no command-line (ssh) usage required after initial install.* Useful collection of add-onsI have been using this for over a year and am quite happy with it.
213,2021-03-11, IPFire, 2.25-core154,10,1,Flashed the ARM version of IPFire 2.25 on a tiny NanoPi R1 (1Gb) which I replaced the Open-WRT that it came on the eMMC. The WAN is 1Gb and the LAN 10/100Mb which is more then enough for my home internet that is connected to a 1Gb 8 port switch. I decided not to use the builtin WiFi and purchased a TP-Link Omada AC1350 AP (PoE) for full coverage  of my single floor 3000 Sqft house (AP centrally mounted). Flashing was almost easy. Really like all the functionality this has. Has a very noticble speed increase over my old Netgear router. I imagine I will be limited to installing too many add-on packages due to the NanoPi is using a ARM cpu.

Blazingly fast, in fact probably the fastest Linux distro I've ever used. Dead easy to install and a nice clean but stylish interface. I opted for Cinnamon on a low spec laptop and it ran like a dream. Unfortunately, it does not appear to have a GUI for software and like Endeavour, uses the command line. Please excuse me if I've gotten that wrong. Normally that's alright by me but this laptop has a small screen and I didn't want to go blind, staring a terminal. I also had a issue with UFW being installed and activated on start up. It persistently turned itself off. Really odd.In short I did not keep Artix. I do think it would benefit from a graphical software manager. That said, for someone installing it on a laptop with a decent screen who is happy to work from the command line, tjhis is amazing. I will be keeping an eye on it for future consideration when I replace my ageing primary laptop. "

It's fast, reliable, and gives you complete control over your system. If you're tired of systemd's grip and looking for a refreshing alternative, Artix is the way to go. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!I'm using KDE Plasma with Dinit; Dinit is like a ninja—silent, efficient, and lightning-fast. It handles the startup and shutdown processes flawlessly, without any unnecessary baggage. I would advise to try Dinit rather than the standard Runit, which is fine, a bit Spartan IMHO compared to Dinit.All in all, I'm impressed with how streamlined and robust Artix is.

There's Clementine for your music collection, mpv for video playback (I'd like a more sophisticated configuration file, though I can understand the lack of it as it's closely tied to each user's hardware), GIMP for advanced image editing, Inkscape for vector graphics, Firefox with preinstalled privacy addons, Audacity for audio editing, Kdenlive for non-linear video editing, Libre Office, Digikam for photo collection management, even Lutris for your gaming needs. The list goes on and for some categories there's even the 'second-best' alternative present.More advanced users will delight to find out a slew of power tools pre-installed and at their disposal, they're just too many to list here. A graphical package management utility is also provided in these editions, ideal for beginners. All these are beautifully assembled and arranged in a pleasant warm dark theme, augmented by the redshift utility which takes care of your eyes after dark.Given all these amenities, the learning curve is smooth for beginners.

The community editions by the way are the recommended entries for new users, as they get a full desktop experience without having to tinker around until they get their stuff squared out.The community is friendly, especially at the forum; almost every topic gets a [SOLVED] tag within a couple of days and many user requests are satisfied with package additions to the ""unofficial"" repositories, [universe] and [omniverse].All supported inits are fast too, but s6 blows everything out of the water: in my laptop it boots to console login in 2 seconds."

That is, the recompiled driver's performance becomes unstable.  This is probably because its codebase is a little behind the kernel codebase?  I guess that's what you pay for, when using a rolling release.Anyway, one solution is to have two USB wifi adapters - an old adapter that has an in-kernel driver, alongside my newer, faster adapter.  When the latter becomes unstable, I swap it out with the former.Another solution is to use the fact that Artix comes with different kernels - when a vanilla kernel update causes Wifi issues, I switch over to the linux-rt kernel for a time, which is a sub-version or two behind.  It is very easy to swap kernels in Artix."

Artix is the only distro that offers 4 different init systems to choose from and supports all of them equally well. In fact, the devs have done such a great job that it's possible to switch among inits and none be any wiser.Depending on your skill levels, you can start almost from scratch getting a base ISO and customizing to your heart's content; you can actually perform a base installation using the convenience of a graphical ISO too!More advanced users will use their favorite DE flavor and obtain a minimal, lightweight system with just a handful of basic applications and build upon it. Novice users should go with the community editions which offer almost anything a regular user would ever want: browsing, video, graphics, audio, office and even programming - the selected applications are usually the best in their class.Kudos to the home-bred dark theme, which is warm and easy on the eyes, applied universally to all preinstalled applications.

243,2022-11-13, Artix Linux, 20220713,10,0,"Artix Linux provides a systemd free environment with a choice of OpenRC, RunIT, S6 and Dinit. I have used OpenRC, RunIT and Dinit. The pacman package management system along with the fact that Arch Linux repositories can be enabled as long as one understands that some systemd stuff will leak in and systemd services will not work as PID 1 is not systemd (one will have create those ""service"" files for the init system that they use if Artix does not have it), means one can easily get applications through Arch Linux's Community repositories not offered through Artix's repositories (this is improving as the Artix's package base increases in size over time) or even through AUR packages.It is awesome to see that in the Linux universe the freedom of choice is again a real concept over what initialization application one can use for PID 1.When Arch Linux first switched over to systemd from the previous init, it just seemed so complicated with systemd and something always came up which seemed to more difficult than necessary to fix. Thus I moved to Arch-OpenRC packages when it first appeared. I loved the simple way openrc initialization work and are very simple to trouble shoot. No voodoo magic going on for PID 1. Simple text log files and the speed just blows systemd away. The evolution into Artix Linux was a massive undertaking in time and effort. The team has out done itself to get a total of 4 working stable non-systemd init systems for the user to choose. The user has an excellent choice of many desktops or even window manager only setups.I use Openbox with tiling rxvt-unicode terminals (configured to 4 separate tiles), tint2 panel and several XFCE applications to provide a stable really fast space to work in which does everything I need that a full desktop provides. The init I am currently using is Dinit. It is easy to configure and the ""service"" files are straight forward. It works well and the commands seem easier for me to remember than OpenRC or RunIT. The graphical installer on the latest release ISO as of this writing : artix-plasma-dinit-20220713-x86_64 worked very well with only customized partitions (several disks plus tmpfs for /tmp and ~/.cache folders) and defaults for the rest. After a ten minutes or so I had a working desktop on my computer ready to use.If one wants a truly free on configured environments then the best choice is to use the base image and install the packages without the configuration packages to get a vanilla installation. Otherwise you will have to alter the desktop configurations afterwards if you find the provided configured desktops settings not to your liking and/or need additional requirements.If the user is familiar and comfortable with command line or at least willing to put in the effect to learn the command line stuff through research as this distribution is not aimed at new Linux users (at first a steep learning curve), one will be rewarded with a functional stable environment though as with all OSes some updates may need one's manual attention.As far as gaming goes, Windows still has an edge though I have found that all the games I like to play are available in Linux through Steam and run well. Thus I no longer run Windows at all (say goodbye to Microsoft spies). Running systemd free makes Linux more like Unix again and less like Windows as systemd did IMO.The fact that you can install a great OS and have one of the best performing computers is awesome.

The comunity is very helpful and not cocky, unlike on Arch forums. I hope this distro will be even more popular in the future, cos for the time being, it really is a nice little gem in the sea of linux distros.Plus you get the option to pick desktop like (xfce, cinnamon, lxde, lxqt, kde..). I can highly recommend it. So far I haven't really seen any major bugs or slowdowns, nothing that a quick google search can't fix at least.  "
245,2022-11-09, Artix Linux, 20220713,10,0,"a truly wonderful forked arch spin - the ready made .iso's give a vanilla DE on which to paint your picture.  Both KDE and Cinnamon are already mature and don't need much done to them, xfce/|Lxqt need a bit of work but nothing a quick google won't solve.  Dinit really is the lean, mean sprinter in the race compared to flabby, bloated sysd and it most certainly shows on a daily basis.  Why is this so low on distrowatch?  Quite clearly somebody who didn't have a clue has been systematically marking it down for a very long time and rather than learning, has been blaming it for their own shortcomings - haters gonna hate i guess!  A decade into my linux journey and absolutely nothing else I've tried comes close.  Highly recommended. "
246,2022-11-04, Artix Linux, 20220713,10,0,"A little known distro, but of excellent quality. Rolling (based on Arch) but stable, I have been using it for years without major problems. The few that occurred, were solved easily with the help of the forum, which is very helpful. Without systemd (it mainly uses Runit or openRc for booting) it is particularly fast, with a medium power machine (for example an i5 + SSD) you are ready to work in about 20/30 seconds. The shutdown is practically immediate. The distro requires a minimum of experience, it is not suitable for those who are at the first approach with Linux, however it could also be fine as a first approach but with the patience of being able to dedicate a few days to read up and do the first installation. There are 3 types of installations: basic (command line, you need some experience, as mentioned before, and there are no pre-installed apps, here you can build your work environment in a totally customized way), intermediate (with graphical installer and a certain number of pre-installed apps, but just a minimum ...) and complete (with graphical installer and a complete set of pre-installed apps). In any case, it takes more or less time to read up a bit, it's not a distro click and go ... I made the intermediate installation, it's a good compromise, you learn something without taking too much time and without downloading tons of sftware that maybe you don't need it. ideal for those who are not really experienced. Highly recommended, it will be a nice surprise. Scalable learning curve, from modest to challenging, the choice is yours. I gladly made a donation, really deserving developers. I hope it will last over time."

On their forums you can also pretty much solve any issues that can arise, which are rare since their package vetting is also very good (for example when upstream arch shipped the grub update who broke on some uefi systems etc). The default images have a sensible base on which you can get a nice system up and running rather quickly, the desktop environments and gtk/qt are also themed with their custom theme which is elegant. It's not the best distro, but it's in the top 10 for me, and i daily drive it on some pc's for about 2 years now happily."

In todays LInux world, most Linux Distributions are freaking useless, and most of them have nothing to really be impressed by, but Artix Linux does what rarely any Linux Distribution does, but Artix Linux is different, however it still has the flaws of not being an independent Linux Distribution, which can cause a lot of problems. Right now, Artix Linux is doing pretty, but for how long? For how long can they maintain the project? This has been a question that has worried me for a while with Artix Linux, and when that day comes, it's gonna be a really bad day, and we already see such things happening, but let me make that statement clear: If you want Arch Linux without systemd because you prefer the speed of runit for example, then forget it. If you want a systemd-free Linux Distribution, then move along this isn't a viable option as well. In my opinion, you may lose more of the benefits of Arch than the pros that you would get with Artix Linux as they are still under control of a Linux Distribution that is changing really fast. For me, this has been a huge reason on why I am leaving Artix Linux, however I don't want to see this project fall, I just don't want to fall with them. Nevertheless, it has taught me a lot of my road on using Linux besides Void Linux, and it is really good actually, but it has me worried that changes such as the complicated way of using Arch Linux's repositories had to be made to have a systemd-free Arch Linux Distribution..."

However, if you have some experience (such as if you've been using Arch for a time) , then a little bit of thoughtful perseverance will end in a great result - the  minimal DE base installs act as a solid foundation to construct a system tailored to you, same as a base Arch install would after a DE/WM has been added, just with a sleek init put in the place of sysd.

I can't go back to systemd now that I've taken the red pill among init systems. Don't forget to add ILoveCandy and uncomment the parallel download line in /etc/pacman.conf. Also add the chaotic-AUR which is a must nowadays imho in any Arch-based distro. I've also added pfetch rather than neofetch in my .bashrc: it is more lightweight and there's a pfetch Artix logo too! I've ditched Falkon browser for Brave. The default login manager theme for the specific flavour of Artix I'm using is gorgeous: the DNA one.I had to install Gcompris for my nephew which wasn't available in the repos but that wasn't an issue as I've installed the flatpak version.

255,2022-08-22, Artix Linux, 20220713,10,0,"For me it's the best fork of Arch as it only removes the terminal cancer it has, aka systemd, and keeps everything else exactly as it is.Artix continues to evolve over the years in a splendid way. It has most Arch packages in its own repositories, almost eliminating the need to add them later to get any missing packages. It also has some extra repositories with pre-compiled AUR binaries, already patched in case they have dependencies with systemd, which is great for those with slower machines and without much processing power for compilation. Updates are always on par with Arch, sometimes it takes a maximum of 1 day to receive them, so those who love Arch's ""bleeding edge"" feel won't miss it here.There's not much more to say, the system works exactly as it should, regardless of which init system option you choose. Some differ in certain ways, so just pick the one that best suits your tastes and needs. Either way, the system will be fast and stable, which is the beauty of Artix."

257,2022-08-13, Artix Linux, 20220713,9,0,"been using linux for over 10 years and learnt on the way, so thought I'd see what Arch without sysd is like (been using vanilla arch for a time, which is great) - well, it just got even better - very fast startup/shutdown times, and i never really saw how inefficient sysd was until i tried a more efficient/stable/secure init (dinit in this case).  As with anything linux, the drive for streamlined code adds to the overall efficiency of the OS, and Artix is a cracker!   Many months down the line, not a single hung process or error, and feels remarkably robust (even more so as its a rolling release, as with anything Arch derived/forked etc).   Personally, i wouldn't recommend to someone remotely new to linux (using linux without learning much still equates to ""new""). simply because it will need a bit of configuration from the users end, and without a baseline of knowledge, i can see this frustrating some folks.   However, with a good approach and some knowledge, it doesn't get better than this for a home linux install, as long as a regular update is done (it is a roller after all, and not doing it will result in problems, so if your pc doesn't get used/updated for weeks on end, stick to the wonderful debian instead etc).   Recommended. "

Has all the benefits of Arch Linux. I hope no one will argue with the superiority of Arch Linux.Behaves quite stable. Any failures, errors, problems are not noticed.Fresh packages. The package base is 2 times smaller than Arch Linux, but I did not encounter any problems, everything that I used on Arch, I found here. And you can use packages from AUR Arch Linux.Pacman is the fastest package manager, especially with the parallel download option enabled.There is an archive, like arch, archive.artixlinux.com. Therefore, you can solve the problem of constant updating when installing new software.As with arch, an advanced level is required."
261,2022-06-07, Artix Linux, 20220123,10,0,"This is a very fast OS - it is forked Arch, so the slowness and inefficiency of sysd is out, and a sleek, efficient init in its place.   I wouldn't recommend to someone new to linux because what you get with the ready made .iso's is basically Artix base with the minimal required on top to get to a basic desktop and anything else you're going to do yourself (bluetooth/cups etc depending on the base DE) - same as if you'd installed arch base and installed the essentials to get to the DE of your choice.   But, if you know a little bit, and are willing to learn a bit too, then this will give you a fabulously fast, stable, and individually tailored installation.  A little bit of effort gives a great reward.   Wonderful!"
262,2022-05-26, Artix Linux, 20220123,10,0,"If there is any sentence that could define in a nutshell exactly what Artix is, it would be something like ""Arch in its pre-systemd glory days"". I had the pleasure of hearing about this distro on a Linux subreddit a few months ago while I was looking for something solid and fast that escaped the arms of systemd as an init system. And besides getting this, I still have the possibility to choose from more than 3 different options to use as an alternative and surprisingly they all work very well! This becomes noticeable after a few days of use, you get the feeling that it is a more polished Arch, but without leaving the core of what it is behind. Following Arch's philosophy of ""Keep it simple"", Artix in my opinion is the fork of Arch that comes closest to that, and that makes it the best option you can find out there, since for me this is something pretty attractive.I am running it on my two main computers and both are running fast as a rocket and using very few resources. So far, I have not experienced any instability, freezes, slowness, crashes, or bugs due to updates, so I am pretty happy with the system as a whole. The best part of using an operating system is not to worry about these kinds of things."
263,2022-05-07, Artix Linux, 20220123,10,0,"I must say that this is a very fun distro to try and possibly learn something new, even if there are no plans to stay using it.Artix gives you the possibility to choose between 5 different init system options, and furthermore separates them into individual ISO images for each one, which is good for evaluating them separately. There is also the possibility to test this with a pre-installed graphical environment like plasma, xfce and others. So nice!I am currently using Artix on three different computers, with three different init systems, being respectively: OpenRC, Runit and dinit. I was legitimately surprised at how fluid the Arch base looks with their integration into the system, as all three performed better than systemd in my tests. It boots faster, the system consumes less resources, and the best part, it doesn't bring along a plethora of other tools that you don't even need for the purpose of starting services and/or supervising them.So far I haven't found any errors or problems with packages or the system itself in the absence of systemd, everything is running fast and smooth. I usually use WMs instead of DEs, so I don't install as many packages as others might, but in my particular scenario, everything goes very well, even for games, which is very good!So I strongly recommend giving Artix a shot."
264,2022-05-05, Artix Linux, 20220123,10,0,"Honestly, I was looking for a distribution that combines the installation of Ubuntu, the amount of applications of Debian with the strength to offer an alternative to the imposition of Systemd and D-Bus. If, like me you are looking for these qualities Artix KDE is perfect, consider that I was using KUbuntu. My hardware system has AMD FX8100 , RX560 on top of an MSI motherboard. Activating some repositories and paru I've installed VirtualBox and PlayonLinux successfully with a very good audio thanks to pipewire. It is possible to use ROCM but it requires many; many hours of compilation. I could successfully use the proprietary drivers (sigh) of the tablet/graphics display without any problem, and all the Appimage applications I need. Compliments at the ArtiX team.

Also Feren OS is very stable, but without the latest and greatest - also uses a few Linux Mint tools as opposed to KDE, but you get Plasma DE with quite a few pre-configured layout options.

As a developer, it has a lot of the necessary tools I need to use on the daily built in.KDE however does still struggle with seamlessly handling nVidia-AMD dual-graphics systems like Laptops, as such I did have to give it a lower-than-perfect score. I had to install some 3rd party packages just to get graphics switching menus, which still require me to reboot to enable changes to take effect.If you're on a single or all AMD/nV-Intel system you'll probably fare better with graphics, hence why I didn't score it lower as this can hinder the OOBE for a lot of gaming laptop users, but not all. Plus this is a KDE issue rather than a KDE-neon issue. Let's see some more hardware integration!The software selection is good. You DO get Snapd installed by default but to my knowledge there's no snaps installed by the Neon team. You otherwise get the full suite of KDE software with no additions beyond firefox, leaving you free to extend the system as you wish.The new tiling system in 5.27 is what saved me going back to PopOS. While it's not perfect compared to Pop-shell, it's very capable and makes handling multiple windows on laptops much easier.All in all, KDE neon is a stable and powerful distro that gives you bleeding edge desktop features on a stable base, and makes a great daily driver for anyone who wants a 'vanilla' KDE experience."

It was much easier for me to install and setup over a KDE iteration with a RHEL core.  I am enjoying making it my own and am not having any of the issues that others have had with freeze ups etc.  I am not concerned that it is not a standalone distribution, it doesn't even consider itself a distribution.  I like the ability to be on the cutting edge of KDE Plasma development that rests nicely on a stable Ubuntu LTS.  I am not having to learn an Eco-system that is foreign to me. But instead, can use my skill set and feel comfortable with KDE. In summary, I have used KDE Neon in the past and am glad to see that it has progressed to be very easy to install, maintain, and the ability to do as much ricing and tweaking as one desires.  I would recommend KDE Neon Linux Distribution to anyone that enjoys KDE."

I lost power, which has hosed some distros in the past but Neon shrugged it off and booted like a champ. Discover(the software center is much more responsive than in the past which is good.

The main menu is improved by including favorites as easy to read/select icons rather than a list, and is very snappy. Right click works all over the desktop, for example you can right-click on an application in the main menu to bring up a context menu for setting that application as a favorite or pinning it. Similarly, (left) clicking on an item in the Dolphin file manager automatically launches the associated program. Overall just a very nice and usable environment.

I've installed Solus OS 4.4 Mate as I didn't like budgie just about a week ago on 15 years AMD Athlon 250 with 12 gig of ram, a SSD drive for the OS and a 16 tb HDD drive and an AMD Readon ATI video card. So far, Everything is working fine. It plays my music, movies and series very well without problems.Some software were not there, such as rkhunter and clamav antivirus and forensic software.So far, everything's working fine and it's pretty fast loading. One more thing, I wish they had a XFCE ISO instead of Mate or Budgie. It would be grand. Anyway, keep up the good work and I hope more people will use it. Thank you. "
320,2023-07-20, Solus, 4.4,10,3,"I have come back to Solus Budgie on my work box.Pros-> It is every bit as good as Solus always was for me, quick and simple to install-> Fast to boot up-> Intuitive to use-> Really easy to resolve any concernsConsOnly one-> Will it now stand the test of time.Solus is really up there with the big names, love it.New users to Linux will find their way around really easy.For the experienced users, that are fed-up with fussy systems and have gotten over all the tweaking and playing, but just want something to work, Solus offers this.Respect to the Devs."
321,2023-07-20, Solus, 4.4,8,6,"It is good to see Solus back. I installed the Budgie edition, mainly because I like Budgie, Solus is the reference distribution for it, rather like Mint for Cinnamon or Neon for KDE, and I have had problems with Budgie on Fedora and EndeavourOS.And it is excellent. The big winner is the responsiveness of the desktop, something Linux frequently lacks and compares badly with Windows. Solus clearly has some very able packagers and kernel experts because the only remotely comparable distribution in my experience is Pop OS, which is also obviously developed by technically savvy contributors.Budgie is as it should be - minimally configured with no glitches, and the general set of packages is minimal too. That said, there are a large number of plugins in the repository. I have a bizarre liking for the weather plugin, which is just right and doesn't bombard the viewer with information.The big risk with a non-derivative distribution was lack of packages. I use the past tense as, since Solus' heyday, flatpaks have largely filled that gap, but the repository has a lot of non-mainstream but welcome packages where a flatpak is not technically possible or undesirable due to the amount of machine access required. For example, I was resigning myself to configuring my VPN by hand then noted that the Mullvad client is there. And Solaar is there, at the latest version unlike almost every other distribution, for my Logitech MX Keys Mini.It appears that the semi-rolling release model is still being used by Solus - large updates each Friday with subsystems updated in a block (for example, GNOME 43 applications and background technologies are default in 4.4 and GNOME 44 is being considered now that we are past the .0 release), and small updates in between where there is a major security issue. From experience this is the right speed for a distribution update, allowing testing before release.I take off two points; one for the Software Centre, which as many others note badly requires an update (could a plugin be written for GNOME Software which understands Solus' package format, rather than reinventing the wheel - the standard version of Software, not the Ubuntu fork, works well) and one because the project has had a tumultuous time over what feels like eternity and a period of stability is desperately needed and just beginning to be demonstrated.If Solus can keep knocking the updates out every week that is enough for me - it is a welcome return as it is a fast and technically impressive distribution."
322,2023-07-17, Solus, 4.4,10,4,"I have been trying to find a suitable distro for an older laptop.  After trying Mint, Peppermint, Q4OS, and others without success...I came upon Solus again.  The MATE version worked!  Wonderful and simple and everything installed correctly.   The others I have tried had installer issues.  Solus and their webpage was very helpful also. I can't wait to try Budgie on my other machine.  Great work guys!  Solus is alive and well!  Great OS!!! This is a wonderful distro for those that don't want all the crap installed.  "
323,2023-07-14, Solus, 4.4,9,2,"Really glad to see Solus back up and running. They'll have some goodwill to recover, but I sincerely hope they succeed with the new team.I took the KDE spin for a spin and I would rate it as follows:- Right back to the super responsiveness of previous versions. Probably the most responsive KDE experience I've had.- All software works the first time - again superb return to form,.- Same great selection of wall papers.- No updates as of yet, but previous versions never gave me a problem. The only issues I had were with installations from the ISO - and that was clean this time round.Docked a point for the following:- Software store needs an update. I know it's in the works and the team was working hard to get a new release out to improve the projects image, but I hope this is a top priority as it  needs to come sooner rather than later.- Plasma is a bit buggier here than with other distros. KDE wallet pop ups are really annoying. The wireless would require re-login at random times, - Issues with the Solus themes: Window controls are hard to see with some apss, effectively invisible. Subjective, but dark theme is too dark and text in light theme is not black enough.I haven't tried the other desktops, so the negative points may be entirely limited to the KDE implementation. Otherwise, this is a very impressive second (third?) chance effort by the team. I'll be checking new releases for a while (hopefully less time between ISO updates this go round)..Bravo guys!!!!!"
324,2023-07-12, Solus, 4.4,10,5,"PROS:Sound leadership has been restored to Solus, and that makes all the difference in the world as far as usability and the unique Solus experience that it is known for. It is literally re-energized and it's vision is back.This distro has a dedicated global crew--don't sell this aspect short. Tireless.I updated an existing 4.3 to the 4.4 and the distro is even better. Budgie keeps evolving in better ways. Wrinkles that arise are dealt with swiftly. This time around Solus feels like it's on a mission.I've run all sorts of distros and this is stlll the best and most hassle-free.Still renders beautifully/crisply compared to many distros, and I've seen nothing stumble OOTB. Small repo is a myth anymore but flatpaks integrate pretty well, too.I stand by the score of 10. I could not be anything else.CONS:I have another distro that I liked and installed and I have no reason to fire it up anymore:)"
325,2023-07-12, Solus, 4.4,10,62," I'be been using Solus since 2019 - it put an abrupt end to my distro-hopping.  I started out with the Budgie edition, which was then being created in-house, and it was dubbed the ""flagship"" DE for Solus.  Later, I switched to KDE Plasma, because it offered more configuration options that appealed to me, such as fractional scaling.  Solus is usually described as a ""curated rolling release.""  That means it offers a selection of software that is carefully selected as being actively developed, and is usually among the ""best in class,"" in my opinion.  Typically, updates are released on Fridays, and they install very quickly, depending on what packages been upgraded recently, so it's no burden to keep Solus up-to-date.  A simple ""sudo eopkg up"" at the command line is all that's needed, or you could update graphically from the Software Center..  In fact, it's possible to progress from one version to the next simply by updating regularly.  There's no need to install updated versions from new .ISO files every few months, or settle for an LTS (long-term-support) version.   Solus is also very quick in general.  It starts quickly, and exits quickly.  I believe this is because it doesn't load and enable a large number of unit files during startup.  While I've typically found that other distros load between 70 or 80 of these at startup (and sometimes more), Solus loads just 3 or 4, depending on the DE.  The more a distro needs to load during startup, the more it needs to get rid of during shutdown.  The difference between Solus and other distros is very noticeable. Solus' .ISO files boot to a ""live"" session that allow it to be evaluated fully before any changes are made to your computer, and when you're ready, the excellent installer can be run from that live session.  The installer will make use of disk partitions you've already defined, and allows you assign mount points to those.  Alternatively, it can do all the work itself when started with an empty disk, or replace an existing OS, or even install itself next to an existing OS.  All of this is easy to do, and nothing is ever written to your disk until the very end, after you've hade an opportunity to examine the tasks that are to be done and confirmed that they're correct.  Installation is fast, and typically takes only a few minutes.All the Solus editions come with a good selection of software pre-installed, so that users are ready to do useful work immediately after installing.  So-called ""right out of the box.""  Yet Solus doesn't stuff your computer with software you'll probably never use, like multiple browsers, numerous editors, and so on.  That's what the repository is for, and it's easy to find and install more software using eopkg at the command line, or the graphical Software Center application.  It's also easy to remove software after you're sure you'll never need it.Solus' forum is outstanding, with experienced Solus users and team members happy to help users with any problems they might encounter.  It's not unusual to see someone to jump in to help within a few minutes after an issue has been raised.Cons?  Sorry, I don't know of any. "
326,2023-07-11, Solus, 4.4,10,4,"I had reviewed before (then, also positively, before the distroś ¨wobbly¨)Firstly I have to say that I am overjoyed that Solus has returned to the Linux arena.All the plusses are still there:- fast boot- independent Linux- excellent up-to-date app selection in the store- light on CPU- gets out the way for workflow- stable rolling release- love Budgie desktop environmentA huge plus is on my old MacBook late 2009, everything works, no lag, wifi is fast.  Manjaro (which I also love on my Lenovo) didn´t play so well on this older hardware.  So here I am, running a fabulous modern operating system on an old bit of kit - how green can you get!Minor niggles: - Flatpak support is there, but needs to be integrated into the Software Center- some consistency with theme on different apps needs ironing out (though there are work arounds with Dconf editor)So so so glad you are back Solus devs - Please, stay this time :-) xx"
327,2023-07-11, Solus, 4.4,10,0,"Coincidentally, I read the blog that outlined the recent problems. I was impressed by the consequences of this, such as a robust server structure and an extremely competent team. I find the innovative future base (Serpent OS) and the crossover cooperation of Solus and Serpent OS so fascinating that I installed Solus 4.4 KDE (Wayland). In my user case, everything works, and it's stable, fast and responsive. I like the software center, especially since I find everything I personally need. The future of Solus looks good and I can see myself migrating more machines to Solus."
328,2023-07-11, Solus, 4.4,10,3,"I've used Solus Budgie as my daily driver (for Linux) for the last several years, and the 4.4 update does not disappoint!  The latest challenges I've tinkered with has been trying to find a systemd free distro that can run well on old/odd hardware.  I purchased a KingJim Portabook XMC 10 (with the groovy fold out keyboard) that runs on a decent 64 bit Intel Atom processor but it only has 2gb of RAM.  Also, there's an optical mouse embedded in the keyboard.  I first tried Refracta but had a frozen screen (otherwise a great distro), next I tried Antix (it didn't freeze but the built in optical mouse was not recognized), third I tried Solus 4.4 and it worked like a charm!  It surprised me that Solus could do what Antix couldn't do.  Also, since Solus OS activates zram by default the speed was exceptional given the unit only has 2gb of RAM.  I'm going to stick with Solus OS as my daily driver.  Budgie is so clean; it's a pleasure to use.  Plus (rolling) updates are very convenient. I also like the fact that Solus 5 is just around the corner.  The Solus team seems to hell bent (in a good way) on leveraging the latest technology to do things better than the rest.  They are experimenting with Rust.  Plus, the build system (move to boulder) and package manager (move to moss) and packaging format improvements are just around the corner when version 5 is released.If you go with Solus, you may find--like me--that there's nothing quite like it."
329,2023-07-10, Solus, 4.4,5,0,"Solus at one time was awesome... and unfortunately they have fallen behind the pack. Currently as it stands it's not something I would jump back into again. I used it for a few years and moved on from its decline.The software center needs a major overhaul. It's dated and still does not support Flatpak installation from the UI.Budgie is still pretty much the same as way back when. Personally, I love KDE Plasma (LXQt for older machines) and prefer QT in general over GTK.With their other offered desktop environments you don't get the full experience like in a Ubuntu/Kubuntu, Fedora/Fedora KDE Plasma Spin, openSUSE, etc... What you get is a big chunk of it. You'll find things missing here and there which makes it feel incomplete.It's nice to see some life coming back into this project and I wish them the best. But I've opted for a distribution with a major financial backing, maturity and long history of success."
330,2023-07-10, Solus, 4.4,6,0,"I have used solus  os since the 3.999 version untill 4.3 and i had no problems with those.but with the 4.4 KDE release its a no go for me,i have horrible screen tearing on desktop when i move windows around and on youtube videos,youtube videos on full screen is ok but on the default video size its horrible screen tearing,this on x11 if i change to wayland screen tearing goes away but the system becomes unstable,lags and crashes firefox,Im just a regular user with little linux experiance,i tried to fix the screen tearing but i had no luck,also i find strange to have so few screen resolution when i go to choose  the correct screen resolution for my screen on solus 4.4,on solus 4.3 i had more to choose from.I also tried the solus budgie 4.4 edition but its the same problem.i am sad but i can not use the system like this.My pc specs intel i5/2400 with a gtx 750ti.Maybe on the next Solus release all that will be fixed.Chears from Portugal and sorry for my bad english"
331,2023-07-09, Solus, 4.4,10,2,"As a long time Linux user, I stumbled upon Solus in 2017. Over the years I watched it growing up to a really mature, user-centered, modern and very well curated MS Windows replacement. Since about two years Solus is the only Linux kernel based OS that I have been  actively recommending to less experienced computer users who were finally fed up with their Windows environments. And all of them still are happy Solus users.The Solus development team suffered from a few very nasty accidents in the first months of 2023, partly caused by really bad luck, but also because of weak project management. The team learned from it, and established in no time a much more solid way of managing the distribution. In my opinion it also is a very good sign, that the founder himself and a few long time co-developers returned to the team to support the future of the OS.This newest release 4.4 ""Harmony"" is an exceptional achievement: in relatively short time the OS got completely up to date, maybe even ahead of its competitors in the Linux world.Worth mentioning is also that the development team and the supporting community have had, and still have a high standard of quality and sincere friendliness from the very start. Everyone with a problem is helped out fast and with enthousiasm.Summarized: Solus is first choice for regular computer users!"
332,2023-07-09, Solus, 4.4,10,2,"I switched to Manjaro when Solus went Dormant. Once the new team took over and started working, I closely monitored and saw cool updates and changes. Switched to Solus once again 2 weeks back and everything is super smooth and nice.I use very less softwares and everything is found in Solus. Budgie is a awesome, please give a it a try. It is light, awesome, timely updates no breakage. Keep up the good work team!I highly recommend this to new users, you won't find it difficult. It is super easy. (long time Windows user here)"
333,2023-07-09, Solus, 4.4,10,4,It is so good to see Solus up and running like a dream. I used Solus for years but after having concerns for the future of the project I moved to Arch based and then Void. Solus has now addressed those issues and has this latest iso point release and it is wonderful to see. I have returned to Solus and it feels great. For a rolling release Solus is as stable as anyone could hope for. Thank you Solus team for your dedication to the project even through some difficult times. Im back back home with Solus.

The installation is fast, the booting is fast, all the necessary software is there, I never found any slowdowns or problems in the previous systems either. I happily switched back from Manjaro to Solus. I use Budgie desktop, I don't need a lot of settings, it's completely suitable for the purpose. I think everyone should try it, and I'm sure it won't jump between distributions, but will stay with Solus. I hope the upward trend continues at Solus."

Updates continued and forums, main site, and help are back online. Budgie is still the flagship with Plasma and Gnome behind it.

The main difference vs fedora is the semi-rolling release since it will update weekly and after some internal testing first , for the last 2 years that i have it as my main NEVER had broken after an upgrade (in compare to Arch based distros)Highly recommend it but for newer users i would suggest to wait for a month to be fully distribute any upgrades needed and then do the jump."
338,2023-03-30, Solus, 4.3,5,12,"RIP Solus...I was very happy with Solus since 2018. Recent catastrophe with leadership has sent this one spiraling downhill. Unfortunately, there has not been an update since January, and the website had an outage that lasted a couple of weeks. Overall, my experience has been great, but with needing to be on an up-to-date machine and no future in sight for this distro, sadly I'm onto the next one.Hope to see this one come back in the near future as the dev has briefly mentioned on Twitter, but even there it seems like it will not be likely. "
339,2023-03-28, Solus, 4.3,10,5,"Solus was built as an answer to where the linux desktop was around 2016-2017. When a point release upgrade was more of a risk of nuking your desktop, Ubuntu and its derivatives were leading the scene, Arch needed manual intervention practically every day, and package dependency issues in general were way more rampant. To say things have come much further since than would be an understatement. It's all in the kernel these days. As others have stated, a reliable backing should really be among the first things you consider when choosing a distribution. In my opinion, the most reliable/reknowned distros out there are Fedora, Arch, Debian, and Opensuse. Others do exist and may fit your needs but these 4 are the ones I think should be at the top of the pyramid, only straying from them for niche interests or hobbyist purposes. Void to me is similar to Solus, curated rolling while unique and rewarding to use, but it is managed by a very small team and has had a history of bus factor halting development of the project.Solus being so great is what made many realize the potential and usability of Linux. But this doesn't have to be the end of the line for users out there whose introduction/comfort zone in Linux was with Solus. I understand that feeling but instead of putting your faith in others for curating your perfect desktop, find a more ""vanilla"" distribution and do these very tweaks yourself. You'll find it to be as rewarding as using Solus ever was and your system will be more stable as a result of you knowing what you did to it. Instead of grieving take the lessons learned from what Solus did and use them as your guide to perfecting your desktop on a more reliable base.Solus' timeline has become the most definitive example of ""bus factor"" negatively impacting a distro I've seen in my 20 years of using Linux. It is true that when it comes to a distribution, having a reliable foundation/backing/infrastructure/team is essential for the life of a desktop OS made from Linux. Solus itself was built upon passionate ideas and genius implementations, probably the best package curation I've seen for a desktop distro period. But it didn't take long from the distro's conception for its creators to begin abandoning the project and causing serious rifts for those who stuck around. It happened to Solus several times in different phases, some giving reasons (resigning) or just straight up going MIA without a word (twice now). And overtime those who were maintaining the project going forward (volunteers, btw) have appeared to have abandoned the project as well. I personally was warned of the risks of using ""passion projects"" or a concerning ""bus factor"" but I always ignored them, that didn't matter to me because Solus just felt so perfect and too good to be true. It was.I will never forget Solus however. Nothing but the best memories and beneficial lessons taught to me. It will live on as (in my own personal opinion) the best ""feeling"" OOTB desktop linux distro that has ever existed."
340,2023-03-28, Solus, 4.3,2,0,"Please, if you want a distro with up to date packages but stable and with a secure future, just choose openSUSE, Fedora, or Void.While these distros have their flaws, they are more likely to survive and not die out than Solus.Many people in the linux community don't like distros that are backed by a company, but for me it is nice. It allows me not to worry about if my distro is going to malfunction or die just because a few project leaders left. For example, Ubuntu has lost many community members but that does not stop the distro. If you want a community based distro choose Debian, Arch and Void.If a distro has been without any updates for 2 months, then that means it is not reliable. For Solus to get back up, its developers need  to Communicate more about what's happening. I mean if the distro is discontinued, tell us. If the infrastructure can't be recovered tell us. We need news about what's happening.There's a reason why distros like openSUSE and Fedora are rising in popularity. Its because they are more communicative and less likely to die. So, in this present day basically, there is no reason to choose Solus over Fedora, openSUSE and Void. The performance of Solus is now present in most other distros out there. And how do you expect new users to use an almost 2 year iso while other beginner distros, like Ubuntu and Linuxmint, have up to date installation images?TLDR: Don't use Solus. Its like flagging a dead horse at the moment."
341,2023-03-27, Solus, 4.3,1,2,"Solus is in crisis right now, and I suggest that potential adopters hold off on Solus until the current issues are resolved, one way or the other.  Solus encountered a ""perfect storm"" of several single points of failure coming together at the same time in mid-January, and the issues have not yet been resolved.  Solus, in a word, went down, and has not yet bounced back.  As a result, Solus has not been updated since mid-January, and should be considered a security risk at this point. The team has released no external communications to the Solus community since February 27.  It is not clear whether Solus will survive.In two decades of Linux use, Solus is flat out the best distro I've used, by far.  I wrote a full review a year or two ago and won't repeat, but Solus had a laser-focus on ordinary home desktop use and a carefully curated rolling release model that always worked flawlessly.  Solus stood alone as a shining beacon of what a distro could, and should, be.  But for the fact that Solus is now a security risk, I would give Solus a solid ""10"" rating, as I have in the past.I hope that Solus will work its way through the crisis and survive, but because the team is not communicating with the community, I have no idea about the future."
342,2023-03-26, Solus, 4.3,1,11,"user since 2017. It's been in a spiritual vacuum chamber since the very communicative Josh Strobl left. Since then it's delivered several months of tepid silence bordering on disingenuous when it came to issues of distro commitment. Even the package maintainers don't know what to say anymore. This was my digital family and it's very painful to watch.This operating system cannot be used right now.It's linux, I get it, everything is free, and volunteers have never owed users anything. The decline of maintenance was also apparent.these things happen but watching a Camaro morph into a Corolla in an act of self-immolation has been rough to witness.I had to find my Budgie experience elsewhere, Solus. If you come back for reboot 3.0, I will cross that bridge when it comes.Possession of the distro should go back to Strobl and Doherty.cons: unsafe; doesn't update; security risks and cve's unaddressed; iso is archaic; unmaintainedpros: was the best out there; may again be someday"
343,2023-03-22, Solus, 4.3,8,1,"Solus gave us a taste on how a rolling linux distribution from scratch should look and feel, although there was never any support for fingerprint locks, smart card e-signature tokens, or lots of proprietary printers. I prefer to think that nobody from the developer team is dead or impaired, while they are definitely incomunicando, but are just moving on to an even more wondrous Serpent OS in preparation (Beatrice alongside Doherty, Strobl, and others...) Rather than reinstall, I bought a new laptop for a fresh Manjaro (Budgie and Plasma all along), so I can keep an eye on this ever more buggy Solus, while it lasts. I suppose someday MS Windows will be also dead and all those users who saw little change over the decades, will be a lot more desperate and inadequate, in a funny way."
344,2023-03-22, Solus, 4.3,1,7,"Shedding a tear for this one.It was a top tier distro for a long time, but its staff have taken hits over the past few years and it basically has not been properly maintained for at least a year now. Communication from the team is almost entirely lacking. The official website has been DOA  for nearly two years.It seems to be fictionally dead.  If it is still alive, there is not much easily accessible info to say that this is the case.To the team - if you have real problems that are keeping you from maintaining and communicating plans and status, close shop on this one and reopen under a new name with new infrastructure that you can control.  If you really have staffing issues preventing you from properly keeping the project going, state this and close the doors.Solus, you were great while you lasted, but the time for change is well past.  Please, end this or change course - nobody wants to dance with a zombie"
345,2023-03-20, Solus, 4.3,10,15,"Yesterday, the developer of Budgie demoted Solus as a ""recommended distro"" on their site.This comes after over 60 days of the distro having no package updates and the users becoming increasingly frustrated and worried about the operating system they're using. There have been many times I have stood by Solus through hardships and seen it to the other side, but this time the hole feels too deep to be able to climb out. My system hasn't had a package or security update in 2 months. There are no signs or reasons to believe it will get back to normal at this point, this situation cannot be justified by responsible leadership. I don't feel safe using this distro anymore and I don't feel comfortable recommending it to others.I'm scoring it a 10 because I believe that's what it is, in my opinion the best user-rolling-distro that has ever been available to users. An indie FOSS phenomenon. Genuinely speaking, I will hold onto the memories of Solus dearly and forever, I will miss it like a lost family member."
346,2023-03-08, Solus, 4.3,6,18,"User since 2018. After Josh Strobl left the project, things sailed south. The Budgie experience and flagship became hobbled and mostly unusable; an unworkable experience due to upkeep and stack update. For many weeks. The other three offerings are fine.It's unique, one-of-a-kind, visually luxurious operating system. It was a pleasure for a long time. I feel safer with solus than the distro I recently moved to.By the time its woes are sorted out, and the package updates pushed, it likely will have been two months Solus has been almost entirely offline, without updates.That says everything right there.It was already withering with no communication and nervous longtime users, but after this long blackout I can't see any return to the norm."
347,2023-02-10, Solus, 4.3,10,28,"This is a very good Linux distro.   Very fast, very strong!..   Runs like a charm.  Should be placed in the top 20.   Using a different package manager... So what..  No big deal.  This distro is a big contender.  Easy setup.  Nicely configured desktop.  A good selection of colors on terminal window.  No problems with audio or  video.  All works fine with no additional fine tuning...I highly recommend this distro , either you are a new Linux user or experienced, doesn't matter.  It will serve you good. "
348,2023-02-08, Solus, 4.3,8,1," I have been distrohopping for most of my life and I settled on Arch for a long time, but recently an update broke all of my systems triggering me to jump onto something else and I cam across Solus.  I think that my biggest take away that I found useful and best about this distro is the amount of modern pacakges that I always use and have difficulties installing and keeping updated, specifically like bitwarden, mullvadvpn, prusaslicer,telegram,signal and element .  They have packages for all of these and I don't have to chase down appimages or flat paks"
349,2023-01-27, Solus, 4.3,10,6,"Solus is a well-born distributiom. I've been using it since the 2019 mate edition, is among the top 3 i've ever used with this desktop, side by side with the debian testing and arch. It's solid for a rolling, much more functional compared to the other big ones with the same programs they offer and that i use.I think the problems they are going through right now, shouldn't tarnish the reputation of the distribution and their team. I believe they will get over it soon.Another point in relation to the iso, somewhat outdated, after all a major update is necessary when installed for the first time, but the fact is that in the last test i did, before the official website went down, about dns failure, the mate version worked without problems, both in the installation, as well as the big 1.23 gb upgrade.It takes the necessary time for the team to fix the problems, we cannot compare in this regard distributions that have a large team behind them to solve this type of problem, so solus deserves one more chance and not a condemnation."
350,2023-01-22, Solus, 4.3,2,5,"The things that made Solus great are still embedded inside of Solus, but the issue is ever since its creators left it has been in maintenance mode, purely, 0 developments or ideas or plans or commitment to the OS they ""run"". These very things are finally breaking.Solus can't even be downloaded right now, all of the websites have been down for nearly 2 weeks as a result of the team being unable to handle the workload and unequipped for DNS changes. You can find an ISO if you find yourself on their Reddit page which is the only source of information on this outage- ""we're working on it"" the usual type stuff. Solus is finally collapsing after years of being held together by strings and duct-tape."
351,2023-01-15, Solus, 4.3,10,1,"Solus is very fast distrib and now quite customizable and complete compared to a few years past, kde chrome and wine work very well for my desktop. Very fast in startup and in applications. Gentoo and arch seem slow as turtles by comparison. In my opinion a revolutionary distro hope that Solus makes the community grow . Now that I have installed it, I am convinced to use it, I will also test the efficiency of the updates. I am a linux user for many years, in my humble opinion it seems an excellent way for the future unfortunately not advertised enough. I had a good look at the KDE verson of Solus and I must say, I am really impressed. It's clean, very fast and has most programs that are worth their salt already ""in the box"""
352,2023-01-15, Solus, 4.3,1,4,"I really loved Solus, Sadly its fallen badly. Its pretty much on life support/a dead distro despite the denials. Only the package maintainers are keeping it going. Things went bad when Josh Strobl resigned a year ago. It would be very dangerous to install it now as there are errors that have not been addressed and a lack of updates. With every day its losing relevance and with the growth of independent distros like Void or good old Slackware, Solus is just getting left behind. I really hope it rebounds from its problems but doesn't look like it at the moment. So I would stay away from Solus until everything is addressed."
353,2023-01-10, Solus, 4.3,1,5,"Solus is a very sad case of neglect and incompetence.I'll start with what made Solus great. Solus is (was) the only rolling distro that:+is actually usable on the desktop OOTB+doesn't require manual intervention with updates+survived/avoided multiple distro-wide errors across 2021-2022 causing steam or steam games to not launch, ie freetype2 glibc/eac pipewire so on+can run games at a framerate comparable to Arch with zen kernel or even WindowsThe problem? It's dead. There's noone besides the package maintainers themselves working on it anymore. The project has become stagnated and irrelevant. It is beyond just on life support, it is borderline dangerous to use Solus at this point."
354,2023-01-09, Solus, 4.3,3,0,"Solus 4.3 Budgie has a lot of promise but fails to deliver. The iso to usb process went off without a hitch and Solus live loaded without problem. The test run was mostly good with addition of a browser and a few dress up apps succeeding without problem. There are a few issues such as no useful welcome screen to advise new users, especially those without in depth Linux skills. The machine i ran Solus on is a 2015 iMac and all the hardware worked without complaint. But, when I tried to install Solus to my hard disk in dual boot mode everything ground to a halt.Compared to other distro's like Mint the process was sparsely documented and left a lot of questions. There is a basic 'clean install' or 'advanced install' offered. The clean install does not seem to be a candidate if you want to dual boot. That leaves the advanced install where you need to 'assign mount points to partitions you have previously created'. No mention or gui are offered to hint at what partitions you need, their size or formatting. The default result in the 'next' screen gives a plain text grid where the choices of mount point for the displayed partition/device and to format or not leave it to you to play detective on where the link to the selections are.  The text indicates only swap and system part's are displayed,  that you you should edit as necessary, and then restart the installer and begin all over again. In hit or miss fashion you can eventually get the 'next' link and move on. Solus asks for a network name, indicates a mandatory bootloader install if you have UEFI, and displays the dev where the bootloader, apparently will go. 'Next' takes you to the user setup. Again, not explained, not intuitive, and a bit of a job of detective. The 'next' screen is a Summary of the setup. The summary would be nice if it just had more info on what is about to happen. Something like: 'Solus will now be installed on (device) with X GB. of disk space formatted as (filesystem). (Name of user) with administrative permissions will be created (or more if you set up for them). The name your network will see for this device is (name you specified) and a bootloader will be installed on (device). The existing operating system will remain in place and be accessible through the bootloader.' Instead, you get some of that info, hints at other info you need to be confident before proceeding, and some foreboding implications that you have some nasty surprises coming your way. There is enough commonly understood terminology among Linux users to warrant that developers of these distro's make the effort to be explicit, clear, and concise in guiding users through installation. As it is, the attractive eye candy and some novel approaches to utilities and applications in Solus goes to waste for those using other products, like Mint which goes in almost automatically, comports with existing OS'es and can come pretty darn close to being as fun to use as Solus."
355,2023-01-03, Solus, 4.3,10,33,"Solus is awesome, a pleasure to use. Lightning fast OOTB and super stable over time, something you cannot say about most rolling distros. I've had it installed since 2017, and here we are in 2023 that exact same installation is as lean fast and reliable as it was one day 1. If there's anything against it I could possibly say, it's that it's ""boring"", but that's only because it works so well. While most other Linux distros feel the same, Solus feels like it goes out of its way to be unique, it is a distro that is truly in a class of its own."
356,2023-01-02, Solus, 4.3,5,3,"Solus was an excellent distribution. Unfortunately, it is currently running on life support only.There has been zero progress on the software center for quite some time. Been waiting for an updated interface and full Flatpak integration. But EOPKG applications are still updated separately from Flatpak (which must be done by command line).Budgie is OK but again there has been zero progress for as while. KDE Plasma is much better and way more powerful. As well as up to date.Solus still offers a fast, stable experience. And for that it's a 10/10 from me. But for how long is the question.I gave it a 5/10 as it has not been progressive for quite a while. It's really too bad. I think they have a ton to offer the Linux world."
357,2022-12-17, Solus, 4.3,4,7,"Solus seems very promising on the surface, but it is a poor choice for multiple reasons.Linux Steam Integration, which comes enabled by default on Solus, breaks most Proton games. The team is aware but refuse to fix or remove or even simply have it disabled by default. Because of this alone, I cannot recommend Solus.1. The ISO is old and this wouldn't be a problem if the user was made aware that they should update before installing new packages, but there is no notice of any kind. Because of this you will frequently see users trying out Solus and having their installs break shortly after installation. eopkg works great besides this though and the update scheme of Solus is quite reliable if you know what you're doing.2. The current version of GNOME apps don't mix well with the current state of Budgie so as a result the current Solus Budgie looks like a Frankenstein desktop. You need to tweak and workaround to get dark mode running properly and it's a poor redundant implementation. The team have posted workarounds and have settled with this for months instead of properly addressing the issues. Nautilus is still broken months later on Solus and Budgie and there is no cohesion to be found in any of the desktop elements, which was once a big appeal of Solus Budgie, it looked premium and modern. It's kinda ugly now.3. The Solus software center has trouble remembering which apps are currently ""installed"" once you remove one from the install section. You need to close and reopen the SC every time you install one package. Very buggy software, has been this way for years.4. The team doesn't communicate with their users. The bus factor is to be considered as well- if you have an issue, Solus is so small that you're likely the first one to encounter it and bring it up. So Solus lives up to its name as an independent distro, but not exactly in the best ways.5. The website is years-outdated and full of grammatical errors that the team are aware of. It represents a lack of interest and integrity in their product.Solus is unique in that it is the only rolling distro that is (supposed to be) easy to use and desktop curated and performance tweaks. It boots the fastest I've ever seen any distro. But that's where the compliments end, and these benefits were thanks to the original developers of Solus who are no longer around. The current ones keep breaking these very things..Considering these numerous shortcomings and the remaining team's incompetence to address them or inform users of their future intentions with the distro, I cannot in good faith recommend Solus."
358,2022-12-15, Solus, 4.3,10,8,"I love Solus... I really do.They are doing so many things right. It's not perfect but no distribution is.This was my daily for a few years but have since moved on to Fedora due to things seemingly falling apart within the Solus team. So I was unsure of its future.Just decided to check in on Solus and installed the KDE rendition. And... it's still great!It has the latest KDE Plasma desktop environment, a very recent kernel and performance is still outstanding.Independent, Rolling, Relevant, Swift, Stable.I'm not going to hop back to it yet till I'm confident it's sticking around for a while. In the mean time, I'll continue with Fedora KDE Spin but keeping an eye on Solus."
359,2022-12-11, Solus, 4.3,10,14,"Focusing on Solus as a Windows replacement for desktop gaming PCs.Not many people seem to talk about this or point it out, but beyond being a great desktop OS, I believe Solus is the best Linux option for gaming.-Rolling release, meaning (as of recently) you get the latest kernel and drivers for your hardware. And you can rest assured that you aren't getting a bunch of server or business enterprise related packages because Solus is...-Desktop currated, it is not your traditional rolling release that required maintenance overtime, Solus comes preinstalled with custom tools/services/scripts/hooks (such as usysconf, the ease of eopkg, unique clr-boot-manager configs and more) that handle all of this for you. But the system is extremely lightweight and bloatfree despite this. You will be astonished how rock solid Solus stays overtime due to its...-Independent base. Not based on Debian Arch Fedora none of that, Solus lives up to its name, it built its own base. Because of this, Solus is able to exist not only as a linux distro but as a desktop OS in its own right. It is undoubtably linux, but it's an extremely unique and premium take on it, performance tuned and intended only for desktops. And that's what users with gaming PCs who care about gaming, something that can turn on launch Steam and launch their games, they want a....-Desktop that just works. Gamers don't want to have to fix their OS first to join their friends ingame. They want to turn it on, update real quick if required via a (in-house!) GUI package manager, and move on.(I would like to mention that if you can use Windows, you should probably just use that for gaming, but this speaks for Solus as an alternative for Windows, in case the user does not have access to it, doesn't want to buy it, doesn't prefer it, or is simply bored of it and wants to try something new. Not every user out there is passionate or knowledgeable enough to install Arch with a performance-patched kernel and keep it maintained through updates overtime, just to have Windows-like gaming performance outside of Windows. In my experience for this use case, most other distros besides Solus will lead to headaches down the road with the point upgrades or focus on non-desktop crowds.)All of this is why I believe Solus is the most headache-free, premium feeling rolling distro for desktops in the current Linux landscape, at least when it comes to needing a non-Windows OS for PC gaming."
360,2022-12-04, Solus, 4.3,10,7,"With the latest kernel updates and boost in maintainer/user activity, I think Solus is fully recommendable again. From my experience it's the most unique and usable desktop rolling distro that exists. How and why has been stated before, it would be redundant to just copy paste what others say, but it's true- Solus is desktop Linux bliss. In ways other patch-it-up-from-the-parent-distros try to be but fail, Solus succeeds. I'm glad it's at a point again where the future is bright, it would be a true loss for an open source phenomenon such as Solus to just die out."
361,2022-11-25, Solus, 4.3,9,12,"I like Solus.pros:- It boots fast - fairly light on resources- budgie is a pleasant desktop environment- Solus gets out the way to allow productivity- doesn't require hours of tinkering to get a useable system- independent linux and not just another version of arch, debian or redhat- rolling release- flatpak support- good update scheduling (not incessant)- works well on older 64bit computerscons:- suffers from 'small team' scepticism- gnome integrated nextcloud online services doesn't seem to play well for me (there are workarounds)I keep coming back to Solus as when I turn my computer on and want to quickly get to whichever function the computer is being used for, Solus just works.  It works perfectly with MacBook late 2009 "
362,2022-09-18, Solus, 4.3,1,2,"the solus installation process completely destroyed my computer system, so I had to wipe off the hard disk and do a clean standalone install of it, but still the installer refuses to register itself with the BIOS, and I was unable to boot into it. previously i was trying to dual boot it with windows, which allowed me into solus but windows became unbootable. I have never come across such an awful OS in my life! absolutely terrible, it was nice to run on a live usb but such a disappointment when it comes to the installation process! I am now on Manjaro thanks to solus."
363,2022-09-09, Solus, 4.3,3,2,"Solus would be a great choice, if it weren't dead. And it was a great choice up until a year or two ago. As of September 2022, the kernel for this rolling distro is still on 5.15 (mainline is well into 5.19) leaving gamers or necessary advancements in the dust, the ISO is over a year old preventing new hardware from working with Solus at all. The reasonings for this aren't intentional or for stability like some like to claim- it is purely the inability or lack of time to do so. Clearly if they were in a position to catch up they would, but they simply aren't.The ones who run the distro currently aren't the ones who created it. They lack the passion that clearly went into its creation. The initial selling points aren't even of focus anymore, for over a year now it's just been maintenance mode with no plans or information about anything. They love saying how they have no deadlines due to people annoying them, when in reality it is because they lack the ability to come up with a coherent plan for what they're going to do. The former experience lead was the one taking charge of such things for a long time, keeping the distro alive and engaging with the community regularly, but this individual has resigned from Solus, likely due to the very reasons I'm explaining here. There are things in its current state that are either system-breaking, or prevent the user from installing Solus at all, and the team is aware of these things, but they don't seem to care much. Any other distro such things would be priority, instant, if they cared about the product they were maintaining. All of these things would be fine if it were the team's own personal project for their own use, but it's supposed to be an operating system targeting everyone for home computers, and they still market it this way.So I'm not sure who Solus is for anymore, and I think it's time to say the responsible thing would be to just discontinue maintenance on the distro. For the sake of the existing user base's sanity and whatever lasting reputation they intend to leave Solus with when it's officially discontinued, just pull the plug already."

Imagine an OS where you don't have to go download files on the web or find some repo URL or even use a terminal to get the software you want, but just used a centralized GUI app called Software Center with wonderfully curated software. Imagine an OS that was built solely for desktops and nothing else. Imagine a desktop OS made by humans intended to be used by humans. Imagine the perfect, free desktop operating system. Solus.Imagine a Linux distro that just works. A distro that was rolling release, but without the instability of bleeding edge software. Imagine a desktop-focused distro that is mostly unburdened by upstream pressures and isn't based on anything else but was made from scratch. Imagine not having to tweak the kernel or other things to get blazingly fast performance or a clean setup due to deeply embedded Clear Linux patches. Imagine being on the same installation of a rolling release distribution for nearly 5 years without having one breakage or bad experience or need to intervene. Solus.There, I've covered both crowds- the new users and the seasoned Linux user. For newbies, I feel like if a person's first experience with Linux coming from Windows or MacOS was only with Solus, they would have a wonderful time with Linux. And for experienced users, Solus is a greatly underrated and remarkably stable rolling home, the defaults of which likely out-human the distro you're used to using.

Boring, stable, reliable, dependable, consistent, and always there when I need it. It has both a bleeding-edge kernel and an LTS kernel. It features Budgie, KDE and Mate Desktop distributions. Gnome is available as well but for how long is uncertain. It has a hand picked, curated repo full of packages that are maintained and work.

Previously tumbleweed was my go to distro, I thought no other distro would ever be good enough or unique enough to make me switch, but nixos is that distro, its very unique, its immutable but unlike many other immutable distro's you can change basically everything about it, you're not just locked into gnome or plasma, or whatever software the distro maintainers give you, if you don't want a full desktop environment and you want to use just a window manager instead then you can, you can even install both and pick and choose what to boot into and not have any of the software from the desktop environment show up when you're in the window manager.You can even install their unstable rolling release along side their stable fixed release and pick and choose what to boot into, so you can literally run the fixed release and the rolling release of the same distro on the same PC, unlike pretty much every other distro where you have to choose if you want to run either a fixed release or a stable release, so there's no risk when updating or running unstable because you can just boot back into your previous stable version just as easy as it is to boot into an older kernel in the grub menu, you can also install different versions of the same software, all your configs are stored in one or two files, so its a piece of cake to reinstall your system to exactly how it was before, you can even save different config files for different desktops or window managers.It does require a learning curve if you like to tinker though, and documentation is lacking in some areas, but apart from that its awesome, I recently put nixos on my mothers two laptops because one of them broke when I upgraded debian bullseye to bookworm, now I don't have to worry about an upgrade breaking the system, its kind of like having btrfs snapshots without having to run btrfs."

It is so well built from the architectural stage that it competes with the very powerful operating systems of the past and present.Traditional Windows and UNIX operating systems do not have this paradigm, I wish they did.Here we are talking about the reproduction of things; you can quickly have a system prepared with everything you had 20 years ago, so that you can feel the experience from then at least from time to time.You can go ahead with the updates without worrying. if you compare the operating systems Ubuntu, Debian, RedHat, AlmaLinux, Fedora, CentOS, Arch Linux and others with NixOS. You will always have a broken OS from time to time, due to incompatibilities; which does not happen with NixOS.We don't like things that don't work and are broken!Notice for the other Linux operating systems, it should improve the user experience and configuration.You have your own build system, which gives you a lot of freedom to build things.Even if it's hard to learn, it's worth it. you know why it's worth it, because you're a programmer and you can learn new and beautiful things in this life.A powerful system that can be customized.You can go back in time to boot for the configuration you want, which gives you a fantastic experience.You can have multiple versions of the same program with small changes made by you; just slightly modifying some derivatives.You can go to different configuration branches to experience old and new things or complicated hardware architectures.You can have what you want with this operating system. Because this OS preserves the Linux philosophy; you to be the master of the operating system, and the system to do exactly what you want.The UX/DX experience is quite good. A reliable system with documentation full of examples.Come on Linux community, let's make this operating system a flagship operating system.I want this operating system to be very attractive like Android, to be used by many people, to have many AI and Blockchain capabilities.From my point of view it is an operating system from the future.And I will always use it from now on.Thank you to the Nix community, for what achievements you have had, have and will have.I will stay with you.I wish that whoever reads this note, will come back here again and share this further.The future is a phoenix bird.IN - 07.2023 :)"

When I was then booted I wanted to build and install my system via the declarative config file of nix of course. This takes longer than usual, but once you have created this file, you can reuse it for every installation. For startup and important info I used the ""Getting Started With NixOS"" guide from It's FOSS, I can recommend it to anyone switching over.And what can I say, I haven't used it for very long, so I can't say anything about stability yet, but so far I like it very much and I am considering using it as a daily driver.The only criticism I can think of so far is that if you don't know NixOS at all, you won't get any help when starting the OS. You have to look for it yourself. But since this is an advanced distro, I think that's ok."
375,2023-06-25, NixOS, unstable,10,3,"By far paradigm shifting and certainly the future of operating systems.No more needing to reinstall your OS each 2 years or fixing package/lib incompatibility issues!.Despite the documentation problem everyone in the community says, I believe that tooling should be more consistent with more guides and examples on how to use it and which benefits users can gain from that, I say that because the community is split to those who use flakes a long with nix commands, and those who don´t, which makes kinda complicated to wrap things in your head.Language is not perfect but far more cool and productive than using yaml, tooling is not perfect but with time it will improve a lot (see Nix language server, LSPs formatters, NixOps lorri home manager and et cetera...).Community is getting larger and larger and more distros are adopting the idea of an immutable operating system, it seems that things are getting better.For those who are beginning right now, take your time and don't rush to do all things once at a time, nix sure has a lot of capabilities but it's important to understand why it's so good. I recommend reading a blog series that helped me (even tho I use it a long time ago) to understand some key concepts I didn't understand before, it's called ""Nix from First Principles: Flake Edition"" from Tony Finn"

I even ventured into the territory of freebsd and gentoo. I am an engineer and self-taught in the world of IT, and with that I see the greatness of nixos. I installed it for the first time a few weeks ago. Getting the basic system up and running doesn't require a lot of effort, but it's just the surface and moving on requires hard learning, especially from those who don't have programming experience. The cleanliness, lightness, flexibility and stability of the system are impressive compared to traditional gnu/linux solutions. You get a special thrill when you work with it, on it. I appreciate that it is resource-based, without dependency chaos, and creative. These directly and indirectly free up a lot of development energy, especially if there will already be a large number of automated modules available to users on a particular topic. I find the integration of non-nix packages particularly problematic. By simplifying this, you can go a long way. It has a bright future. I hope it will not be contaminated with flatpak and snaps technologies and will remain consistent."

That's it!Although there's a learning curve to Nix language, for me the key is to start simple and build upon it gradually. The most complex type, a set, (think of it a some named fields containing a value that is either a string, an interger, a version number, a url, a function... or again a set) is used super-frequently, but understanding it makes mastering the Nix language and ecosystem really achievable. As you become familiar with it (just play with it regularly), you'll realize Nix Language is DIFFERENT, not DIFFICULT.With my last laptop I began using Ubuntu for convenience, but soon installed the Nix package manager due to its advantages in development. Eventually, I re-installed NixOS in dual boot and haven't looked back since. Now, I even consider only using Ubuntu as containers within NixOS.In summary, NixOS offers an unparalleled sense of freedom and flexibility, making it a worthwhile endeavor for those willing to learn its unique language.Last advice for novices: Dont mistake Nix Language syntax with C/Java/Javascript.

Then copy your configuaration.nix file from your github repository and reproduce your system to any computer you like.And the list goes on...

379,2023-04-01, NixOS, 22.11,7,2,"This is an extreme operating system that I want to love. I'm grateful it exists. I really like the nix package manager. That said, unless you have already made the investment, you are going to spend a lot more time than you want to learning how to work around NixOS. In many respects it is NOT gnu/linux, despite meeting the criteria when you look at the kernel and software running on it. That is because it bucks generations of conventions when it comes to how you install and run software. NixOS follows a radical philosophy of dependency management and makes heavy use of linking to create virtual environments. There is no opt-out of this, the operating system is really built this way.Definitely worth installing on a second machine or as dual boot if you are interested in a long road of learning. Definitely not worth installing as your primary OS if you have used other operating systems (intentionally left broad: eg, Ubuntu, Windows, Gentoo, iOS) before and want something you understand and can use."

Rollbacks allow for confident experimentation, knowing that bricking your system is really only bricking that *version* of your system, and can be reverted easily upon reboot. It's a tinkerer's dream OS. It has a very steep learning curve, once you get into the realm of flakes & functions. However, your configuration.nix file really doesn't need all that. You can do perfectly fine with a single config file describing your whole system, from what file system & kernel to use all the way up to specific versions of user packages. Drop your laptop into your bathtub? You no longer have to spend a whole day getting your system back the way you like it. Just install nixos, git clone your config repo, & `nixos-install`. Done!"
381,2023-01-20, NixOS, 22.11,9,8,"In my opinion, NixOS is a great OS. This is because NixOS, other than Guix, is the only OS that offers declarativity while still being good.NixOS is very organized due to all your settings being inside files. For package installation, you add the package to a list inside a file.However, with the new addition of Nix Flakes, everything becomes harder to install. Due to this, I give the OS a 9/10.Also, this OS is pure preference. Even if the OS gets good reviews, you might not like it. Maybe you like immutability and automatic package and dependency management. Your choice. Personally, I like declarativity and package version management.If you want to use NixOS, make sure to install home-manager. Otherwise Nix is kinda bad."

As a daily driver, no way.With so many choices out there, this one is not even on my radar.Straight away, had quite a few hardware issues which honestly was quite surprising.Performance was also lacking. I suppose due to the hardware issues.Tried the KDE edition which out of the box was missing Discover.

Everything stays intact until you ""collect-garbages"" (a nix command).2. You need Firefox with 1500 strange options and different ones for 150 different users ? No problem, when configured the first time, the next deployment are instantaneous. No need to re-set the settings every time you test something or add a new user.Because your system AND users AND sysconfigs AND userconfigs AND applications AND apps configurations are declarative.

The fact that builds are reproducible means that I can have complete confidence that the OS will always work. If a build fails? Revert a version.The only downside is that the learning curve is steep. But come to think of it, that's not the fault of the OS. That's caused by the mess of the current ecosystem that NixOS is (in my opinion) the only sane answer to.Giving it a rating of 10 comes from the fact that my life as a developer and FOSS engineer has become massively more productive and straight-forward. Nix flakes are a gift to anyone working with software. Thanks! "
386,2022-09-25, NixOS, unstable,10,3,"Having spent a number of years with ArchLinux, over the last year or more I have moved to NixOS as my main driver for servers and notebooks. I also use it to compose docker images etc.I like how the community shares their .dotfile configurations and how the makeup of the configurations is how you declaratively manage the system. It just feels much tidier than the imperative methods that are used in most desktop systems.It takes a little of study to come to grips with the Nix language and the documentation could be better - but the community is excellent.There might be the odd trade-off required when using proprietary packages that are not compiled for NixOS. I hear there are ways around that too, but not something that has bothered me enough yet to spend time to deal with it."
387,2022-09-08, NixOS, 22.05,8,5,"So I recently left the Windows world and hopped back into Linux, which I used to use a lot back between 2012-2015.I have been distro-hopping like crazy for the last several weeks. I knew I wanted something more advanced than Ubuntu. The problem is that I am also a distro minimalist, meaning I want a naked, raw operating system. Something without any apps installed other than a desktop. I had remembered reading about NixOS years ago, but never gave it a try. I guess now was the time.Here's what I appreciate about Nix. The graphical installer makes getting started easy. I love the simplicity and cleanness of managing the installed system. I personally do not like Firefox as much as I like Brave. Simply go into the configuration file, delete the line containing Firefox, and add Brave. Boom. Do a simple rebuild of the system, and your system now never even knew Firefox was installed.Ironically, I chose to add apps using Flathub which also runs in a containerized manner, but does eliminate the need to edit the configuration file every time I want to add an app.I don't like that Nix doesn't let you choose what file system to use at install time, at least with the auto format function. I also don't like that some of the most necessary commands are hidden away in documentation or on chat boards. For example, how do you update the packages? It isn't as obvious. Minor nitpickings, but I chose the KDE desktop, and there is a broken icon down in the lower left corner. I just deleted it.I'm still learning about NixOS, but I feel like this is the system to hang with for the long term. Tons of power and flexibility. You have the option between a stable updates channel or a more rolling distro type of channel, called unstable. I would recommend this system strongly."
388,2022-09-04, NixOS, 22.05,10,8,"I finally tried it out. The installer takes away some pressure, as I wasn't confident that I could jump in and set it all up correctly from scratch. Now that I had this base Gnome install though, I realised that the packager and config file setup are not at all as scary as I thought they would be. In fact, it's pretty easy to get your head around and just start building up your OS like you would do with any other distro. The packager is brilliant. It's fast and immensely powerful, and I haven't even delved into ad hoc shell environments and all that jazz yet. A lot of those tools are more geared towards developers anyway, which I'm not any more. And special heads-up for the documentation.. it's really, really good.The default Gnome is great (I hope the other desktops available are as good as this). It's clean and it's stable and fast. It's the only distro apart from Ubuntu-based ones that automatically found and set up by Brother printer and scanner.The amount of packages available is awesome as well. The whole thing feels like the stability of Debian with the cutting edge of Arch and the updated Gnome of Fedora. It's incredibly well thought-out. I hope to get my new 'built for linux' laptop soon. I'll be able to try out how easy it is to replicate my current setup on a new machine.For anyone hesitating to try it out, thinking it might be too messy to deal with, I can assure you that it isn't. I highly recommend this distro."
389,2022-08-18, NixOS, unstable,10,12,"There is a certain demographic that NixOS will appeal to, as is evident in the reviews here: expert users who used to distro-hop, always searching for something that works reliably for all their nontrivial needs. Many, myself included, end up settling on NixOS. In this review I'll try to outline why I think that is more of a pattern than a fluke.NixOS strikes a very good balance between ""it just works"" and DIY:""It just works"": - nixpkgs is the largest repository of Linux software in existence, both in number of packages and in number of up-to-date packages - especially with the graphical installer, installing NixOS to a graphical system is as easy as with all other graphical distrosDIY: - experimentation without fear of messing up the system (with rollbacks and GC) is rightfully in the spotlight - Nix is source-based, so you can patch packages on the fly - declarative configs mean that at the end of the day, all your hard work can be saved to version control, so it doesn't have to be done again, by you or anyone else - a central configuration keeps it easy to remove cruft that invariably accumulates in imperative OSesMany DIY folks try to reinvent a subset of NixOS through hand-crafted configs that copy and sync their dotfiles, install packages, etc. Nix formalises this into something easier to maintain and reason about.The biggest barrier to entry is of course the steep learning curve. The only way to use NixOS is to learn the Nix expression language and surrounding idioms for building software. It takes about a year or so to attain proficiency, or about half that if you have someone helping you. But like with all foundational skills, it pays dividends in the long run.The benefits of learning Nix: - ability to build and run any software project with Nix, on any distro and even macOS - ability to run software without installing it or any dependencies - by learning how to use the system you also learn how to contribute to nixpkgs / NixOS itself, which is how it has become so large in the first place - learning the functional paradigm makes you a better engineer overallI don't expect that the configuration language will be abstracted away (e.g. by GUI) any time soon. But with improved documentation, the learning curve might become more approachable to the general audience. The community is exceptionally active and welcoming to contributions."
390,2022-08-15, NixOS, 22.05,10,2,"I tried many of different Linux distributions before and was really happy to meet NixOS suddenly.There is no doubt that the future of Linux World is NixOS.In my opinion it will take not much time till NixOS becomes widely used around the whole planet.IMHO the greatest feature of that distribution is ""rollback"" possibility. It is awesome.Imagine that you have installed something that is not exactly you need, you forgotten to prune itand kept going your searches. Once you've found it and of course you completely forgot about that previously installedunneeded stuff. And one day you will definitely sit in a puddle, because that stuff could broke something on your system.In a generic distribution there is no any easy way to go through the issue, but in NixOS you will manage it by using onlyone command ""nixos-rebuild switch --rollback""!

391,2022-07-07, NixOS, 22.05,9,14,"Like many of the other reviewers, I have also used, with varying degrees of success and fidelity, many of the popular Linux distributions (Debian, Fedora, Centos, Ubuntu, OpenSuse, KDE Neon, Mint, Arch), as well as some of the underdogs now farther down the list as well. For the record, I probably used Gentoo/Funtoo the longest (c. 15 years), which I finally abandoned[1], but only after having learned a great deal about how Linux works, about its strengths as well as its weaknesses.NixOS is by far the most interesting distribution I've used to date, and I think -- might be the future of the Linux desktop. Why? NixOS is, quite literally, an OS built completely around its package manager (Nix and the expression language that supports it). It appears to take aim at solving a key problem of most Linux distributions -- the fact that application software is developed and updated at varying speeds, and those applications use versions of key libraries, which themselves are developed independently and thus have their own production timelines, further complicated by the relentless advent of new hardware, and the leap-frogging between the various elements create inconsistencies (at times quite circular) that can become difficult to overcome (so-called dependency hell). This difficulty seems to me the key problem that NixOS targets, and by doing so places **application software** -- and the resulting experience users derive from it -- at the very core of everything.Many reviews more than a year or so old speak of weakness in documentation. Although still not perfect, the depth and extent of documentation has evidently improved significantly in the meantime. The user group is still small, but growing and (at least in my experience) quite responsive. The installation itself demands only that you understand something about disk partitioning, and are able to customize an configuration file from a generic template to fit your needs. But the key parts are already there: to get a machine up and running is not necessarily a struggle. The struggle really comes later, in gaining a mastery of the Nix language sufficient to fully understand how the system really works, and how to use it create a development environment. This is where better  documentation comes in. A key point, however, is that once a satisfactory `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix' file is obtained, a user could replicate this setup across many machines, making it possible to obtain a consistent desktop experience. NixOS may not be for everyone, and understanding its functionality is not trivial, but such hurdles will also likely become less substantial with greater user adoption and deeper documentation. I feel it has tremendous potential, and the investment has been well worth it thus far for me. I'm very grateful to Distrowatch for showcasing it.[1] Getting bogged down with one too many KDE-QT library issues, and recognizing I was spending far less time _using_ the system than I was recompiling it.

This has enabled me to run NixOS on my old Dell that has only 2GB of ram and 32GB of emmc, on which it runs fast enough to be usable. I  have taken the config from that and used it on my other Dell that has 16GB of ram and a 500GB SSD, it flies but it made setting up the second machine really simple.Pros: -* Dead easy to install using the Calamares installer.* Good choice of DEs.* An opportunity to learn something new.* Over 80000 packages available in the repositoryCons: -* You do need to be comfortable with editing a config file, but once you get your head around the concept, you'll love NixOSI am loving NixOS surprise yourself and give it a go!"

Reproducibility is very important for ergonomics, it just deals with so many headaches. That said, the OS is far from being the most user friendly and not being the most ubiquitous means not everything is supported and every use case isn't covered by a random stack overflow post. Learning how nix works in order to use it has a steep learning curve, but still the benefits are worth it (things are also changing very quickly). "

404,2021-09-12, NixOS, 21.05,8,11,"I switched to NixOS from Gentoo, so that's a very low bar on 'usability'. From my point of view, NixOS is actually extremely easy to use, contrary to what some of the other reviews say. But I realize that a lot of people will be coming from the perspective of Ubuntu, Fedora, etc. and that may not be true for them. At any rate, I've found NixOS so much better in both concept and execution than any other Linux distro I've tried (Linux Mint, Ubuntu, Puppy Linux, Debian, Slackware, and Gentoo), but especially Gentoo, which has been my primary OS on my desktop and laptop for a year. The packages actually manage to outclass *all of those* in terms of what software, at least the software I need,  is available, despite NixOS being much newer in terms of general adoption and having a smaller (I think) userbase than most. Installing new packages and setting up hardware ""just works"" without needing to deal with USE flag nightmares and kernel recompilation (I generally clung onto Gentoo for the latter, since I want to be able to control the hardware support in the kernel, but NixOS still does this without needing my manual intervention). An entire system rebuild on NixOS is faster than installing a single desktop program on Gentoo, and the initial installation (text-mode) took me maybe 2 hours even with no familiarity with the Nix language. I have also seen no reduction in performance between Gentoo and the binary-distributed Nix, and average performance might actually be slightly higher because I'm not having to constantly bog down my computer by compiling source code. Only downsides are that it takes up a lot of space, it can be hard to set up development software (CMake, my beloved), and if a package doesn't work because of a distributor error there's not a whole lot you can do, hence not a 10/10. Still the best iteration of Linux out there so far."
405,2021-07-06, NixOS, 21.05,9,10,"NixOS uses a new paradigm for structuring the system, based on the Nix package manager and providing a very high degree of build reproducibility. NixOS is amazing for developers that are willing to go out their comfort zone and learn new ways. It doesn't take long to learn the basics, but it might take some experience to learn how to package software. It provides great tools for developers, like nix-shell which is able to provide highly reproducible development environments, or tools for building lightweight container images using the same package manager.This is not an easy distribution and requires effort, the status of the documentation is ok, not great, and it requires looking at packages source codes more than you would normally do in another distro, but the benefits are also numerous. It misses a few things that might be given for granted in other distros, such as graphical installers, but the community is active and working to improving the status."

The practical downsides however are mountainous: As soon as anything does not run as expected you are left with a hardly-documented ""programming"" language that has no easily accessible inner logic (and I am a enthusiastic Haskell programmer, therefore declarative stuff is not new to me). There are some resources to be found in the internet that describe the way to work yourself into a being that is able to work with NixOs. As inner peace and the liberation from the cycle of death and rebirth were not my main objectives (an installation to use at the workplace was) I switched after a day of failed attempts to install emacs and texlive with the packages I need."

Since it has different approach than other common distro, when a problem arise, it's very unique, a solution from another linux system most likely wouldn't work, and the poor documentation make it worse. But I like the idea of reproducible configuration, and upgrading and downgrading is painless. It's great for tinkering or used on your personal machine. For work, not so much (unless your team use nixos too)"
410,2021-02-20, NixOS, 20.09,5,3,"I use this distribution daily in a production environment.  It is not a friendly distro.  It does some things well.  Builds are reproducible and it is kind to developers in that it supports having different software revisions available.  But you have to weigh that with the downsides.  Documentation is poor, and use community is nowhere near the size of other distros.  You are tied to their particular programming language to manage your system.  Trivial tasks on other systems require rebuilding the entire system on nixos.  The steep learning curve means that you need to figure extra months of training for every person hired to work on it.  Packages are kept in one massive folder and symlinked out.  This means that no software is going to have it's files and libraries in the place you would expect.  It can be gotten around for most well built software but it's a pain.  Everything with Nixos is a pain.  I feel like it's more theoretical then practical.  It has lofty intentions and does stick to the philosophy it's built around fairly well.  Which is probably good for students and programmers who are interested in these things.  I feel NixOS makes the tradeoff of ease of use and practicality in favor of dogmatic belief in a programming paradigm.  I would not recommend it for use in a production environment.  I would also not recommend it as a desktop distribution.  Unless you are a programmer and someone who is willing to invest a lot of extra time and effort into it for the joy of it acting in a way you think it ""should"" you are better off with a different distro."

This is by far the most impressive distro I've tried out in a long time. There are many cool settings and additions to make Fedora (which is already a good distro) even better.The special tweak tool and onboarding tool are very useful. I am not a power user and on the terminal all day. But the zsh shell is beautifully styled and didn't lead me to switch back to bash. I sincerely hope for the project that interest starts picking up for risiOS.

Keep up the good work!When I started in computers, Linux distributions weren't as good as this is. I love how the word ""risi"" is worked into all aspects of the system which makes it even better.

It used adw-gtk3! This amazed me as I was frustrated that many GNOME applications ship with the latest version of GNOME which used didn't use libadwaita so it looked pretty inconsistent. I like the use of adw-gtk3 in this case.I installed risiOS on GNOME Boxes and after install, it hung on a gray screen, so I had to reboot the machine with that.GNOME Initial Setup was used which was very nice, however there was a minimize button on it and when clicked, it hides the application forcing the user to press ALT + TAB or reboot their system to see the setup again.When I completed the the GNOME Initial Setup, risiWelcome opened up. I really like risiWelcome. I like the web browser part where it shows a description of each browser with its pros and cons. However, I was disappointed by the Drivers screen. Most of the options were grayed out even though I enabled RPM Fusion. It could be that I was using GNOME Boxes and not bare metal but there should be another reason why these were grayed out. For example, if risiWelcome doesn't detect your hardware you need for these drivers it should say something like ""Cannot find hardware to be used by this driver.""For the Quick Setup section of risiWelcome, I liked the categories with descriptions for each application. However, I didn't like the ""Authentication Required"" screen. It said ""Authentication is required to run /usr/bin/bash as the super user."" When installing an RPM in GNOME Software, it has a message which makes sense to ordinary people. I would like the message to change on that screen to make it more user friendly.I have another review which continues this."

So unfortunately, for me, there is really no reason to make the switch to this.It found most the hardware out of the box. Had to go through the same steps as with a Fedora install to get everything up and working.So... risiTweaks is bad. It's clunky and missing some things. To add extensions it takes you to the website?This is resolved by --> sudo dnf autoremove risi-tweaksThen installing Extensions Manager and GNOME Tweaks.I also don't care for the branded risiOS terminal when it's opened along with the tweaks to it.The default theme is ugly in my opinion.Chromium is the default browser? Removed that and installed Firefox.In summary, the out of the box was not to my taste.

Uses the Calamares Installer so it should be easy install for a Beginner.===Install completed, apparently without error.This implementation of the Calamares Installer permitted me to NOT install a boot loader, so it rebooted to my default OS, Debian.Update GRUB and it appears as expected.=== reboot ===Now it is looking for the boot partition and it fails and goes to BusyBox.===Twice more, no joy.Perhaps I Must use It's own bootloader in order to ""properly"" complete the install. OK, I will Reinstall.===OK, I'm in.It's really spartan and uses some odd desktop that's hard to figure out (for me).In-order to Update the packages it wants it requires a Reboot. WTF?===OK, lengthy but now it has populated the apps, and I figured out how to get a terminal installed.Can't find a web browser, I guess that's optionalsudo apt install mate worked, now to see if I can log out and then login with mate desktop.===""PureOS mostly ships with software from the Debian software repository but has all software removed that violates Purism's guidelines and the GNU Free System Distribution Guidelines""Makes me wonder what the heck is the problem with Firefox.===Synaptic to the rescue.gnome ""Discover"" does list synaptic, after that everyting I am looking for is here... Thunderbird, Mate Extras, Conky, etc.The problem was not the PureOS repos not having it... gnome failed to list it.===This experiment has been fun, but now I ask myself Why?I still have not discovered much about how it has been built (stable/testing/sid) other than it is another home brew by a company that markets hardware (really expensive hardware).They have nearly 30 people on staff, but how many are actually going to maintain their PureOS distro?I will keep it on my system and revisit again... but I don't consider it a Keeper nor do I recommend it for most people."

Idea is Run Linux operating system, and for the stuff I cannot replace now a Windows virtual box with those twin 4 k screens. Using RClone for OneDrive mount, (Or OneDrive Online) Evolution Mail instead of Outlook and Gmail...My Bussiness has 6 Email addresses and I have one Private one- (2 Gmail, 4 on my Website server and one Outlook one.) SLACK for Work (my employees collaborate and work on it). Use Gnote for Notes, Brave Browser (Linux-Yes you can install it from their site, I think it is a deb package or via command line.) to eliminate adds and tracking...and so on.PROS: THE ONLY LINUX I could install, with immediate correct screen displays -(ALL RESOLUTIONS AVAILABLE)was PUREOS, together with all this mentioned software from DEB or Command Line. It is super-fast and does not fall over. I first had it installed on a External USB3 SSD without any issues. You can even move the SSD Drive in its ADATA USB case to my laptop or other Older PC. (All newer PC hardware immediately work well, even with Drive de-encryption-Only screen Resolution on HOST PC has to be reconfigured.) Old PC 2010 not so good on the external drive via Old USB 2, but works fine if you use it installed there on its own drive. This OS works as fast as Puppy! CONS: BUT only on ETERNET. You must search for the WIFI Card Drivers and get it installed. A bit of a hassle but works fine once you have it working. The good resource for these Drivers was in my case INTEL website I am not sure I like the Forced drive encryption on Install!! This should be an option-Looks like and Option, but you cannot proceed if you do not tick drive encryption with password!!THINGS I STILL WANT TO DO ON THIS IS: Using MDADM command in Linux to make software raid in PUREOS to Raid 1, with the wo SSD drives in the PC .(Cloning). In case one drive fails. This PC has enough Cores spare for Virtual box and these functions.Install VirtualBox for Windows 10- For ZOOM Videocall maybe or Using MS Excel, because my index & Match formulas do not import into Libre Sheets.

It is funny how these smaller less known distro's can offer such a great system. No longer do I think that the lower ranked (or un-ranked)  players offer less, you have to give them a try and this is one of them.Another added bonus is that the 2023_x64.iso also contains the BOOTia32.efi for those struggling to find a distro containing it or adding it to an iso.A smooth and effortless installation followed by an easy to follow set up for those wishing to add their own tweaks. There is no PUP look here any longer. It contains a whole lot of software should you need it, if not immediately, one day you may and it is there.Overall a great general purpose distro that you should give a try, it may have been asleep for some time but it is certainly back in good hands now.My only gripe, and this is not specifically about legacyos, there are many, many others, is that I really dislike conky configured by default.

435,2023-06-02, Lubuntu, 22.04,10,2,"
Having tried several different distros in the past few days, all of which proved to be so fragile that they self-destructed, I thought I'd give Lubuntu a spin, and I'm glad that I did.I'd tried LXQt before, with Porteus, and it seemed OK.Now it's more mature, and the Lubuntu iteration is nothing less than fairly excellent. It is clean, fast, stable, and has a very informative, interactive user interface.Much as I love LXDE for its configurability, etc., it's dated. LXQt is just as configurable, but it's modern both in looks and feel. I think that the Lubuntu development team made the right decision in dropping LXDE in favor of LXQt.Which brings me to another point. Too many distros are trying to be 'all things for everyone', offering a multitude of DE options, rather than focusing on one and doing it very well.Switching desktop environments involves a lot of work under the hood, especially in ~/.config and /etc. I know this from bitter experience.I want stability and consistency, and Lubuntu LXQt offers this, as did Lubuntu LXDE. I don't have to spend days on configuration, only for the system to break, because I've somehow breached a parameter.There is also the aspect that it is community developed, rather than a personal project that can often seem like an ego trip.I distrust those particular flavors (re. William Gibson's book 'Distrust That Particular Flavor'). They are often very fragile, and tend to be suddenly abandoned.I think its fair to consider LXQt as 'KDE Lite', and I am tempted to try Kubuntu, even though it is very specialized and 'niche' as a a complete DE. I'll probably stick with Lubuntu, because of the greater flexibility.PROS:Lubuntu is very stable. Why can't Debian do this?Lubuntu installs in about 5 minutes.Lubuntu does not enforce swap on installation, giving the option of 'no swap/swap to file'. There really is no need for swap on modern X86-64 machines that can handle more RAM than most users will ever need.The Muon package manager is far superior to Synaptic, which is so dated it's becoming clunky. Even broken packages are resolved as easily as closing and relaunching Muon.Lubuntu is simply a very pleasant experience.CONS:There is no minimal install option, which means having to remove LibreOffice if you don't want it, although that's easy enough with Muon.There's no OEM install option, which would be good for passing on or selling old machines.Calamares installer doesn't recognize certain keyboards when it comes to setting a passphrase for an encrypted install, e.g. '# vs £'.But these are no big deals, just ideas for the future.I would recommend Lubuntu to people who want a light, fast and responsive DE.Well done."

The dual core system I have normally throttles while idle on w10. It really is one of the least resource hungry distrosLXQt is quite consistent, and allows for sufficient customization. You can really consider this version a 'modern' distribution. I guess the only ""downside"" I see is the selection of certain apps, but just install the ones you prefer.It's the first distrbution of linux I'm willing to keep as my daily driver and recommend to others. I can finally say I'll stop distro hopping."

There's not much more to say about it.I do miss the original LXDE, but LXQt grows on you and has many of the same features. The version is a bit old in 22.04, but it's fine. If you want the newer version, you'll have to wait. I do not believe they'll be backporting it to 22.04, unfortunately.As far as distros go, Lubuntu is still lightweight - even though it's not specifically designed to be lightweight. I know of people running Lubuntu on some pretty old computers."

I am a new Linux user and feel very comfortable using it.It is definitely a step up compared to the old LXDE based Lubuntu. It's heavier compared to LXDE of course, but still lighter than XFCE and so on.For my very old machines I still use version 18.04 though.

Was so perfect. Why did you ruined this distro. It had it all. I found a replacement at Ubuntu Mate. It's nice and I can even choose a lighter version at the installer. Lubuntu was light and great, with the right software. It was clean. Great for beginners to get into linux. Either coming from Windows or MacOS. I don't understand why Lubuntu gave up LXDE. I don't get it. My opinion continues to be the same. I don't recommend this distro. It's heavy and has so much bloated software . So annoying. If I could give less than 1, like a rating  of ZERO, I would, but I can't. "
443,2022-05-23, Lubuntu, 22.04,8,6,"It troubles me that those who try a distribution then give it low ratings do not take into account the hardware they are attempting to run it on. This distribution ran fine in virtualbox and bare metal, in fact it was better than fine in terms of overall performance. When installed bare metal I did experience a peculiar issue whereby three USB 3.1 type A ports would not always be recognised at boot time, yet the two USB-C ports worked as expected, but I do not see this as a reason to give a lower rating because a) i'm sure I could have remedied this with a little investigation and b) if this was indeed a serious issue with Lubuntu then their forum would be awash with cheesed-off users, but it is not. So overall I quite liked it. I say ""quite"" because my personal preference is MX Linux and has been for a long time, but I could be just as productive with Lubuntu if pushed.If you own a machine that's say 7 years old or less, has 4Gb ram or more then you will probably appreciate Lubuntu even if you finally choose another distro. But, if you're intending to run any modern distribution on machines more than 7 years old then expect to find your experiences to be less than stellar. As I said at the outset, it troubles me to see one or two very low ratings given to distributions by users attempting to run them on machines that are as much as ten or more years old.

I chose Lubuntu based on brand recognition, as well as having a very positive prior experience with Lubuntu back in 2010-11.I installed it almost 2 years ago, and the only reason I have not moved to Lite or Mate, is because I have several hours of prep work to do prior to making the switch, and I always seem to have higher priorities.The system works, so I am not complaining about that.

I have Linux Lite running on an old high end Dell, with terrible graphics, but it runs great.   I have Ubuntu running on a used Panasonic Tough Book, and it is awesome.Bottom line is that I have been using Linux since 2009, and it seems to me that an identical distro works differently based on the differences between inner workings of the computer - and this is obvious from the spec standpoint for sure, but I am more thinking about it as an internal components viewpoint, and so I may wait for the new Lubuntu LTS release, which is coming up soon, before I make my final decision, but if it does not improve, I am going to put the blame on the incompatibility of the Lubuntu system with this particular HP laptop."

For users that loved the old Lubuntu, Debian + LXDE is now the natural option, or maybe something like Antix that is even lighter than Lubuntu ever were.For those who love LXQt, Lubuntu is a good option, but I doubt there are that many of those users. I continued to use Lubuntu for a while after the transition and even contributed some bug reports, feature requests and translations, but I never felt that excited about LXQt and a few years ago, I moved to Arch, first with LXQt, then LXDE and then with tiling WMs (for even less resources spent on things that do not matter and even more left for the programs I run).

Seems an incomplete desktop, and maybe is normal, because LXQT needs a lot more of work during his development in the future, to try to compete with other more mature or advanced desktops.Maybe someone can fork LXDE and try to give it more life, but for Lubuntu, we have to wait a bit more to see it shine again and for LXQT to have more personality."
460,2021-08-05, Lubuntu, 20.04,4,6,"Longtime user of the 'Buntus.  I first started using Lubuntu back in the LXDE days.  The first thing I have to say is that I do a lot of restoring old computers for people, and all the 'Buntus get a minus three on their rating automatically from me because of dropping 32 bit support.  A lot of people that can't afford computers get old refurbished 32 bit computers and in 3rd world countries they are still far more common than 64 bit computers, so hard scold on all the 'Buntus for that move.  I also have to say that LXQT (they ditched LXDE) does not work as well as LXDE did, in my experience.  The whole purpose in Lubuntu and Xubuntu was to provide lightweight environments for older computers.  Now with the ditching of both 32 bit support and LXDE, Lubuntu is not that OS for old computers it once was.  It is definitely light on its feet compared to the giant sauropods of the Linux world, KDE Plasma and Gnome, but for a mid to light weight 64 bit system, I would say Xfce (Xubuntu in the 'Buntu family) is probably better.  You may be able to squeak by with a little less memory on LXQT than Xfce, but not by much.  Plus, I have had more bugs in LXQT.  If you really need a lightweight distro, I would go for broke and skip out on Lubuntu and head for Q4OS.  It uses the outdated looking, but extremely lightweight Trinity Desktop Environment (forked from KDE 3 - back when KDE was not a memory gorging behemoth), and Q4OS is based squarely in Debian ('Buntus are Debian based to an extent, but there is major reworking).  Being based squarely in Debian means that for those in need of 32 bit support, Q4OS has that.  So my tally:  Minus 3 for not having 32 bit support and excluding those that still have to/need to use those computers.Minus for the switch to LXQT, which (in my experience) is not as sprightly as LXDE.Minus for the primitive look without making up for it in resource gain.Minus for the bugs in LXQT compared to both LXDE and Xfce.Total:  4/10"

Granted it struggles with high-end BBC I-player streaming of TV shows,etc., so I generally use a Samsung tablet for that, but YouTube videos are fine to watch.  As the internal architecture for my Samsung Netbook is only 32 bit, it will not be able to run 64 bit LUBUNTU 20.04 LTS onwards as the 32 bit (i386 software) is being terminated by Canonical (Ubuntu) after April 2023.  This frustratingly I find a shame as my netbook (albeit old) still works and should not be thrown away yet awhile (well not until it has had a major hardware failure anyway, hopefully it might continue for another 10 years).  Disappointed with the Linux Community with their lack of response and interest into what happens to old machines that still work after April 2023, particularly as Linux Users used to always pride themselves in supporting older hardware that Microsoft seemed to abandon. This was one of the many reasons why I, and I'm sure many others, left the Microsoft Windows systems over 10 years ago.

It didn't recognise other partitions, there was no trash, every time I restarted the system went back to the initial condition, etc...

I did install the printer, laptop, libreoffice, and chromium upon installation. "
484,2022-06-10, Star, 4.0.0,10,17,"Star is a hidden gem. It's based on Devuan but without elogind. A truly systemd-free Debian.Star is so minimal. It provides a base which is just enough for users to build their ideal systems upon. Because of its root (Devuan and Debian), Star is light, fast and very stable. During my use of Star, I have never experienced any serious problems. In terms of packages, the default configuration in apt provides almost all packages for normal use. If extra packages are needed, back-port repo should most likely have them. Star is what Debian should have been.Thanks, Star dev team and keep up the great work."
485,2022-04-18, Star, 3.1.0,10,12,"Star, Devuan and Debian are my favorite distros. I just read the only 1-star review on Distrowatch (all other reviews of Star Linux are 8 to 10). Yes, Star is bare and minimal, which makes it great not only for low specs computers, but also as a perfect base for building a fully customized system. It is better to add the packages that any individual user needs to a base system than to remove packages the user doesn't need from monsters like Ubuntu, Mint, PCLinuxOS, Zorin, etc. Why download Gigabyte sized ISOs, install thousands of packages, then remove most of them and break the system? Star netinstall ISO is only around 300 MB and installs a perfect base system. I installed Star multiple times and never got any crashes, lockups or any offers to report the bugs to the developers. I did get all the problems above with Ubuntu, Mint and PCLinuxOS. Ubuntu MATE showed system errors and offers to report the bugs to the developers on every boot, Mint refused to boot after installation and stuck in the emergency mode with root account locked and PCLinuxOS with KDE couldn't install any packages because of network malfunctioning. There are thousands of packages available in the default repositories and adding ""contrib non-free"" to the ""sources.list"" or manually adding repositories gives access to thousands more packages! AppImage or simply installing *.deb packages from the terminal or using gdebi installer adds plenty more. So it is simply not true that Star doesn't have many packages. Star 3.1.0 is based on oldstable Debian 10 - Devuan 3.1 versions. It is about time to release a new Star version based on newer Debian 11 - Devuan 4.0. Star is one of the few distros that simply work. Keep the good work, Star developers! "
486,2021-12-14, Star, 3.1.0,1,0,"Star is a pretty bare and minimal distro, which would be good for older computers with not as powerful hardware, but does a damn thing work with this besides getting crashes, lockups and constant offers to report the bugs to the developers? There aren’t many packages that you can install to get a better day-to-day use of this and the default repositories don’t have a lot of applications in them. This feels like alpha quality software that shouldn’t of been released."

488,2021-11-02, Star, 3.1.0,10,3,"Star Linux Xfce is a very powerful and robust distribution that just works. Many distros use the word lightweight but are they? Star is truly built from the ground up to be fast, lean, and only populated by a few essential apps.Pros: Upgraded to Devuan new stable release Chimaera 4.0 from Beowulf flawlessly. Then, to Devuan 5.0 Daedalus Testing branch flawlessly. Not a single error. Star is simply a project by seasoned developers, evident with how well the distro performs.Cons: Not yet!Try it! "
489,2021-05-18, Star, 3.1.0,8,2,"TREAT THIS AS A CAUTIONARY TALE (and feel free to laugh).I tried installing Star to a Dell 3583 that I had bought as an Ubuntu OEM machine.Star proved to be uninstallable, regardless of which install method (text/graphic/advanced), regardless of the install medium (USB stick/CD-ROM). I tried 6 times, with the same results, every time.The installation came up with a multitude of errors, probably because the Devuan-basis of Star did not recognise the firmware/driver libraries. I was prepared to ignore these as 'to be fixed later', but ultimately, installation failed because GRUB2 failed to install. Whether this was a problem with the Debian Installer (I doubt it) or with the Star build (I suspect it is), I cannot be certain; although I have encountered several Debian-based distros that fail to install for the same reason (and Ubuntu-based distros, likewise). Clearly, the installer is not just an app., clearly not just an afterthought to slot into your brilliant new spin.Fortunately, I have an OEM recovery disc.PROS:Star is like real CrunchBang#! reborn. I think Phil Newborough would approve.Star runs excellently as a live USB, and would be a viable system for forensics or data recovery, especially if it could be given persistence to keep it up to date.CONS:Apart from the hithertoaforementioned saga, the main problem is the lack of hardware compatibility.ALL-IN-ALL:I won't be mean: Star is a good distro that could have a long way to go."
490,2021-04-05, Star, 3.0.0,10,13,"ACTUALLY 3.1.0I write this review from a live usb install of STAR 'Spock' OpenBox.Pros:All of the ISOs are CD-sized.Connection via mobile broadband is easy.On a live session, the firewall starts on boot. That's good security out of the box. Bruce Schneier would surely approve.Minimal: this is a genuinely minimal distro; so minimal, in fact, that it makes CrunchBang#! seem bloated. There is nothing unnecessary included in the live medium (e.g. massive web-browser), but all of the necessary things ARE included (e.g. Synaptic Package Manager). This is a real 'operator's system'.All of the benefits of being Debian/Devuan Stable-based: Ubuntu has a habit of removing available packages, while Debian is less likely to; and programmes/applications that suddenly no longer work on Ubuntu still work on Debian.At last: a real replacement for CrunchBang#! Really: having started with Ubuntu, moved to MadBox, then CrunchBang#! (Ubuntu-based through to Debian-based, until the end) & then been disappointed by BunsenLabs/ArchBang/SliTaz/et al, & since been running customised wattOS, it's good to see that the #! spirit is still alive.Perhaps most importantly for me, all of my config scripts can be copied & pasted into a fresh install, without causing any problems.Cons:Why isn't this distro better known?In summary:If you want to build your own distro upon a solid base, then STAR is a solid base.If you're a nostalgic CrunchBang#!er, then this is the one for you.

498,2023-07-09, Ultramarine Linux, 38,10,0,Using the Ultramarine 38 KDE plasma version for about 1 month. It's been phenomenal experience so far. Everything just works out of the box.I tried installing regular Fedora and also Debian KDE versions but was unable to get all my hardware working on them but Ultramarine just worked straight away.If you're not very technical and you want something that works without having to do too much then this is an excellent option. The most user-friendly Linux distribution I have used so far especially if you want to use up a raid on your machine.
499,2023-07-02, Ultramarine Linux, 38,8,4,"Wow, I have been using Ultramarine Linux since 2022 and it is the distro that made me stop distro hopping and finally concentrate on using my computer to get things done instead of wasting time to distro hop or to rice my desktops.Pros: it really gets out of my way, very clean interface (am using budgie DE), very minimalistic in design and I have no urge to waste time ricing it as it already looks quite pleasing to my eyes. so far, I have never had any major problems with it, everything that i encountered was easily resolved by searching the internet. A few months ago I tried the official Fedora 38 Budgie spin, I had problem with changing my display refresh rate, and there is no problem changing my refresh rate on Ultramarine 38. Not sure if this problem has been fixed or not in Fedora.Cons: I am not a fan of dark themes, so it was a bit troublesome to switch to light theme for my apps, you have to change the universal theme to light using terminal with a command line. Also, I tried upgrading from 37 to 38 using the terminal, it was a failure, could not even boot into the upgraded system, and when I selected alternative kernels to boot into, the system has kernel for 37 but the system itself is actually 38, and it was extremely slow and unresponsive.I resolved this by doing a clean install of 38, and so far everything has gone well.Also, the default shell changed from bash to zsh, which is annoying to me as I could not use certain command lines, for example, to clear my terminal history. This change was not clearly stated by the ultramarine team, hence it took me a while to figure out how to clear my terminal history which was quite frustrating.In conclusion, a good distro that hopefully will not give me much headaches in the coming future!Simple to use and saves you time tweaking vanilla Fedora to get it to work."

I am running Brave and Firefox browsers, Darktable, IDLE3 and VScodium programming environments, and Xboard(my chess game to practice for chess.com).

The stability of Fedora with the coolness of a budgie desktop. Only its newness and lack of bells and whistles give it a ""9,"" otherwise, ""10.""

Plenty of software to offer for download, and all the codecs I need were right in the original installation.Smooth and a bit unique for a Fedora based distro.  It sems to be everything that AlmaLinux has been trying to be.  I would give Ultramarine a 10 rating but for the inability to make the taskbar (""panel"") fully transparent, which is one of my preferences.  VERY nice distro and it's staying on this machine.  "
507,2022-07-02, Ultramarine Linux, 36,10,7,"I love this distro. I have installed the Gnome edition and it has been flawless. I've tried it on several different laptops and had no issues installing. The same is true with the flagship edition except that I just don't like the budgie desktop much. I intend to try Pantheon and it's my understanding they are no longer working on Cutefish. I really like how they've linked to multiple respositories right out of the box, so I've had no trouble installing software that I use and need.  I had my installation up and running just the way I like it in a matter of minutes. Fedora always takes longer because I have to chase down some of the odder packages I use.  Not necessary in Ultramarine.

Result: it's not in the task menue, can only be run from the commandline, specifying the source parameter, no GUI app. I worked around with the Parole -mediaplayer, which obviously is a weak replacement.* memory usage after boot close to 900 MB - not what you'd expect from a low-resource DE like Budgie. Might have to do with zram swap, which I am not familiar with.* shuting down the system takes > two minutes, because systemd is hanging at an effort to terminate some sort of user service daemon.* no printer setup in the system tools: had to resort to good old lpadmin -cli, with the splix -package as a precondition.* invoking Libre Office results in an error message similar to ""missing components"", then hangs for a while, then works.* fonts are ugly, imho; switching from dark theme to bright one takes some effort, especially in Firefox.Pro's:* I guess many glitches are inherited from mother Fedora 36 and Budgie* if you take fun in fixing problems and feel satisfied after having ironed out whatever Ultramarine QC missed - then this one might be for you.

It's quick and easy, once you figure out which disk and partition you need to format or to resize, it's easy. I appreciate all of the disk formats that it's capable of writing (ext4, ntfs, exfat, etc.): it's a useful tool for preparing and modifying Linux or Windows machines (probably BSD as well, but haven't tried that) and the live ISO makes it easier.It's as easy or as complicated as you want to make it to be, if it boots correctly.It does load from Ventoy, so that's a plus.

I was stuck. I had an SD card that needed to be reformatted, but it had to be EXFAT. Guess what? The disk manager program in Zorin couldn't do that. Instead of going through a bunch of complicated procedures to make my installed OSes capable, I simply downloaded this as an ISO, flashed it to a pendrive, and booted and ran it from that.

I looked for a distro which was, at the same time, a valid alternative to gentoo but easier to manage. I tried to install gentoo this year, 20 years after I tried it for the first time, but I had to stop after a week because of configuration problems. I tried Funtoo that seemed to me a possible alternative and now I think it is a great equilibrium. Everything worked as expected after the installation and when I did not find a program in the portage tree I was able to install it from its AppImage version or by decompressing the .deb version and copying files by hand, but this is a issue related to very few and secondary programs. The system seems to be stable and working. I think I'll stop to continuosly change my distro."
525,2022-08-29, Funtoo Linux, current,10,7,When I encountered Funtoo the most meaningful contribution that drew me in at the time was the concept of a meta-distribution. Testing out management and building a metadistribution with select packages made life much easier and manageable. Particularly for resolving hierarchical dependencies of software that I needed. The brilliant use of git to manage a rolling distribution was also a major bonus! With MetaTools coordinating which packages are part of the meta-flavour of Funtoo. The bootstrap evolved methods are also great!
526,2021-11-06, Funtoo Linux, current,8,13,"This is the best Gentoo alternative. It's easy to use, easy to customize because of so many desktop environments available.The 2 negatves I have are-, getting rid of the GNOME desktop enivornment would be great- it's bloated, slow and not user friendly and it's difficult to customize.I would also like more up-to-date versions of applications including ones I use a lot: Firefox, LibreOffice and Thunderbird.Other than the 2 negatives above, Funtoo has been stable, easy-to-use and it has a lot of packages you can install, including a lot more by other repositories you can add in."
527,2021-06-26, Funtoo Linux, current,10,9,Funtoo is a great distro. It has been my daily driver for well over a year now and it has proved itself to be rock-solid and blazing fast.
528,2021-01-16, Funtoo Linux, current,5,1,"Funtoo isn't what it used to be. It's slowly tacking toward more binary installs - forget trying to keep a locally compiled Firefox anywhere near a safe patch level. You must use ""firefox-bin"" to even sort of stay up-to-date with Firefox's multidinous security problems, which invites the question of ""why bother, then, with Funtoo rather then Gentoo?""Worse, it's has the same snarly USE/profile problems that Gentoo has, but a much less active community (moribund might be a more accurate description). It seems harder to even join the forums at funtoo than any other distro. The bugs.funtoo.org website is barely browseable for problems related to Funtoo's software.If funtoo cannot find a more active and engaged community, it's probably not going to survive. The recent three week hiatus perhaps augurs ill for what is, in many ways, a technically innovative and useful distro.

I've been using Linux for over 10 years, and I've tried a lot of different distros. But I've never seen one as bad as the EE version of  SolyxXKI installed it on my laptop, and it wouldn't even boot. It just got stuck on the boot screen. I tried everything I could think of to fix it, but nothing worked.I finally gave up and reinstalled a different distro. I'm so glad I did, because the other distro worked perfectly.I don't know what's wrong with the EE version of SolyxXK but it's clear that it's not ready for prime time. If you're thinking about trying it, I would strongly advise against it.The EE version of SolyxXK is a complete disaster. It doesn't boot, and there's no way to fix it. If you're looking for a Linux distro, I would strongly advise you to avoid this one.I was particularly disappointed with the EE version of SolyxXK because it had a lot of potential. The underlying distro is actually quite good, but the EE version is just a mess.I hope that the developers of [distro name] will fix the EE version soon. But until then, I would strongly advise everyone to avoid it."

I tried KDE Neon, but it had problems, and is based on Ubuntu.  I really  wanted  Debian based distro with KDE as the default desktop.  SolydK is Debian based and rock solid.  It comes with (or lets me easily install) the programs that I like to use.  I now have SolydK 10 running on my Lenovo M92p desktop machine, two Lenovo T430s laptops, and a Lenovo T400 laptop, all without any problems.  I have looked at Netrunner 23 (now based on Debian instead of Arch) bu I cannot see and advantage in using it over SolydK.

I’m not a programmer/developer or a gamer.  I just need a regular home office type computer.  And yes, there are several nice distributions based on Debian-Stable KDE, but this one stands out to me as awesome. If there's a ""con"", maybe it's the uncertainty you get about its continued development, since there are so few announcements or image releases on Distrowatch and it gets so little attention.  The development team must be small, maybe even one person - I don't know.  Regardless, I’m enjoying it now, satisfied that I’m getting security updates straight from Debian, and hoping the best for its future.I'm using version 11 KDE, installed a long time ago (probably spring of 2021) by way of a testing or ""ee"" image obtained through solydxk.com.  It's absolutely fabulous ! beautiful, snappy, and glitch-free.  I liked it so much that I cloned the installation to two other drives to run on other hardware: an old HP laptop from 2009 with dual-core Intel and 4GBs of RAM, an old home-built tower with quad-core AMD and 4GBs of RAM, and primarily on a 2019 Dell Optiplex with eight cores and 32GBs of RAM.  Each system is standout-good compared to other distributions I run on that hardware.  I have accumulated several inkjet printers, and last week I made an assessment of them, plugging in to test function and if any ink remained.  On SolydK, every one functioned without any troubleshooting on my part.  Their identification and driver selection was simple in the “Print Settings” utility.  No headache whatsoever.  For reference, they were: HP Deskjet 2540 and 3550, OfficeJet Pro 6968, 1350 All-In-One, Cannon MG2522, and an Epson NX300In summary, I applaud the work done in crafting this OS and say thank you!

I started with Mint KDE and was disappointed they dropped such a good DE for Cinnamon. I had trouble installing solydk because of the wonky partition prompts but after that it installed with no problems. My first impression is how nice this looks. It's clean, flat and neat. I like new cutting edge look but this has maybe a combination of earlier KDE mixed with modern. It's hard to explain but it looks good. Set up took no time really, just a couple of personal adjustments and switch the icons to Breeze. Discover was being Discover, so it was slow but has everything I use. The entire distro feels snappy and quick and pretty stable so far. Like someone else said, I don't know why this isn't more popular. It's definitely equal to Solus (which is an awesome distro) and has a great future once more people find out about it. From the way things look solydk will more than likely be my new desktop.

I've been using it for over 1 month now and the system never broke.The installation was very good and everything went well. The same with the installations of the programs, done in an easy way, without any problem. And all programs run very smoothly and quickly. The distro is really very stable.Currently I am using SolydX 10 stable version. And I also plan to try SolydX 11 version.I've always been better suited to Debian-based linux distros.

Don't let its lower ranking fool you. IF KDE is you DE of choice, then SOLYDK is your distro.

It also gives you great flexibility for building software - the pkgsrc software collection is developed in NetBSD for a reason.

If you've done system administration on FreeBSD (and I mean actual system administration in a terminal) you should be just fine. There are differences but they are minor, and easy to pick up. The guide and manual pages are very well written. Building the system/kernel is simple. Using CVS might bring back memories. NPF syntax seems a little weird compared to PF but you get used to it. One thing you'll notice is that your /dev tree lists all devices whether they're attached or not. It's ok though, you can check with sysctl or dmesg. This OS is reliable and gets the job done. GUI lovers, I don't know (nor do I care) how it is setting up a GUI or how it performs.

I had to run the installer multiple times because it would randomly crash for no apparent reason. I finally got it properly installed, and setting it up was a breeze. Pkgsrc provided everything that I needed for a daily use set-up. Unfortunately, little bugs started to rear their head the more that I used it. DHCP would randomly go down for no reason at all, and using the command line to bring it back up would fail. X11 would randomly freeze up and/or crash, and the kernel would randomly show weird errors. Some days the errors would show up, and other days no errors whatsoever. I can deal with all of those little things because no OS is perfect. What I couldn't deal with, however, was a huge kernel panic that brought the entire system crashing down. Ok, no big deal, kernel panics happen every now and then....but when I rebooted, the entire /etc was corrupted. No more rc.conf or fstab. Great. Tried to run fsck, but no luck, of course (missing fstab). Somehow, rc.d was also corrupted. Tried to reboot again, but got nothing but garbled characters and eventually a root shell.

(Sorry my terminal only uses 80 columns, must be my fault here. *Please insert cynic joke laughter here.*)Second: Double check the mount-points for your partitions, because they seem to be overwritten with random data (Looks like a buffer overflow error, lol!).Third: The system can't extract any files, because it thinks your empty harddisk has no free space left. (probably a result of the buggy mountpoints)I wanted to give it a try, because I heard that NetBSD might be a good stable BSD for long time server stuff, but an ugly and uncomfortable installer which even crashes on pretty standard hardware is a no go.PS I used the CD-ROM ISO-image with NetBSD 9.2."

It's true, the ports and package system is not the latest and greatest, it's true the wine support and Linux support are old and outdated, but NetBSD is a solid choice for a server. Anecdotally, I used OpenBSD and Fugulta on my older hardware. As a disclaimer, I am a fan of Net/Open. However, both OpenBSD and Fugulta crash with the simplest things, like mounting a cd, or plugging in a keyboard. True, I should use hardware they support, but no matter the case, this should NOT be the case; that is an operating system crashing when encountering a driver or firmware level error. NetBSD in contrast doing these same tasks runs smoothly and does NOT crash. The error handling then is excellent.Now, is it for everyone? Definitely not, but it can't possibly be intended to be, as the people who develop it are doing a great job with the limited resources they have. I do think NetBSD has a future where the rest of the BSDs don't, simply because they aren't trying to be what they simply are not (FreeBSD trying to rival Linux still, OpenBSD trying to be the most secure platform).

An Incredible Operating System, I really love this Distro!It manages to be light, easy to use and incredibly beautiful, it's not an easy combination to find in an operating system, however, it is found in Br OS.Another very interesting thing is how easy it is to talk to the CEO, he is available in Distro's Telegram group.I noticed that it is a Brazilian Distro, however, the system is available in several languages, including English, which greatly facilitates its use by people from all over the world.It is worth mentioning that this distro has done a wonderful job in defending freedom of expression around the world, natively bringing tools to bypass the censorship mechanisms of authoritarian countries."
559,2023-05-10, Br OS, 23.04,10,3,"I love this distro. I have tried many in the past 6 months leaving windows. Most have a issue with a Elano wireless keyboard that doesn't exist. This distro doesn't have that issue like the others. It has acted up briefly, but control is back to normal right away. Besides that, it's KDE Plasma with Debian. And it works flawlessly! Has a an easy to use app store (Discover). Being new to Linux I would highly recommend this Distro!I have installed Gimp, Krita, and VLC very easily. Coming from another Brazilian distro with pamac that had a lot of issues, I can say I prefer this one. If you like a distro based off Kubuntu and installs easy try this one by all means!"
560,2023-03-18, Br OS, 22.04,10,16,"As a recent convert to KDE, I was looking for a stable, Ubuntu-based distro with a relatively recent version of Plasma. Strangely, Feren OS, Kubuntu and KDE Neon all gave me issues on the first day. But this distro, despite being based on Kubuntu, has been working flawlessly for over 2.5 weeks now. In addition to being so reliable, it comes with a great set of applications. You get qBitTorrent instead of KTorrent; Kdenlive, Krita and GIMP are pre-installed, which are programs that I consider essential even for non-creators. Most importantly, it comes with Flatpak pre-installed, and immediately accessible through Discover. Seeing how Ubuntu is moving away from Flatpak, Br OS might be a better choice for many people for an out-of-the-box experience. Also, it comes with OnlyOffice instead of LibreOffice, if that's your thing. I personally prefer LibreOffice, but OnlyOffice is alright too.On top of all that, the desktop is customized and themed gorgeously out of the box (it's using Plank, but it's easy to turn it off if you're not into it), and the wallpapers are probably the best I've seen on any distro ever. Honestly, this is a distro I wouldn't be embarrassed to show to the Windows users for the showcase of Linux. The only problem I have with it is a pretty janky-looking logo, or almost a lack of it. It's just ""Br"" with some Brazilian symbolic in the background. They should really work on their branding. Commission an actual symbol for a logo and overwrite all the mentions of Kubuntu, such as those in neofetch and during the loading screen.The reason my review mostly touches on the superficial aspects of the distro is precisely because it's working so flawlessly and out of the box. I really don't have much to say about the under-the-hood stuff when I don't even have to engage with it due to everything being functional.

I'll join the others before me, with the addition that you need an Amanero Combo USB card that works with exclusive processing (natively supported). Excluding the bugs of the Daphile running device. So far I have used Windows 8.1 OS and Amarra Luxe 4 player. I always review my current settings from time to time, now the Amanero card has made it my preferred player. Brilliant sound, thanks to the developers !Without the aforementioned USB card, the result is heavily influenced by the quality of the platform using Daphile, which could be bad.

563,2021-04-18, Daphile, 20.12,9,19,"I've fiddled around with computer music for about 10 years. Have tried quite a few combinations, including on-the-edge programs like Audiophile Linux, Euphony, etc. Hugely frustrating. Unless you're a computer whiz, or are willing to spend countless hours learning, you're quickly out of your depth. Even then, these programs represent ever shifting sound quality and operational targets, and you must have the time and patience to keep up, if you don't want to get left out.That's why I always end up back with my Daphile machine. It is stable and simple, with high quality sound. The only thing I wish for is a larger album cover display.Considering the big chunks of money you spend on some of these other programs the fact that Daphile is free is a huge selling point. BUT, I often wish there was a way to at least donate some money to Kimmo for this monumental effort."

565,2023-07-26, antiX, 21,6,1,"
This review is for Antix 21 ""core"" plus Xfce4, and I am mainly interested in comparing it with Debian/Xfce4. (I know this is effectively MX, but MX has too much pre-installed software for me.) In its native form on an old computer Antix might be worth a look for some. However, note that kernel upgrades are infrequent and must be installed by hand. OTOH, Antix still supports some old kernels that have lost, or are soon to lose, support from the Debian maintainers - so you might get a slightly longer life expectancy, before having to set about building a new system from scratch, as I don't think you would be able to upgrade it. Antix is built on Debian. Once you add Xfce4 to core Antix, the resulting installation is broadly indistinguishable from a standard Debian/xfce4 - apart from needing more tweaking. Antix takes up a little less space, but to call it ""lean and mean"" in comparison would be an exageration. Any Linux running Xfce4 is pretty lean anyway. One reason I went for Antix was because I had a project in mind that needed a means to build a small linux that could boot from a USB stick. Well, Antix supposedly has superior live-usb building scripts, but I couldn't get them to work. And then I discover Debian has it's own in-house ""live-builder"" - though I couldn't get that to work either! (I eventually found a solution, see below.) My conclusion, if you are not a beginner and have some experience tweaking a new install, unless Systemd bothers you terribly, I'd be sticking with Debian going forward. It will definitely be easier to upgrade a Debian system from one major version to the next; I've done it and it's fairly straightforward unless you have exotix components. But in the end it depends what you're looking for. If you want something that ""just works"" OOTB choose Mint. If you want to build it from the ground up, say Arch. Debian/Xfce4 sits somewhat between those two extremes - minimal included software and eminently customizable - but still not for beginners. Also Debian still does 32 bit, which might be just as useful as Antix on an old box. For building live systems I recommend the Slax Linux Live scripts."
566,2023-07-17, antiX, 22,9,6," Been distro-hopping for months now. Looking at reviews led me to antiX 22 now. Running on my Toshiba 505D AMD Dual-Core M500,2200MHz, 2.67G RAMEverything worked out of the box.For a single OS install it was an easy install.AntiX is clean & fast.  Provides me with a welcome opportunity to learn enough linux to reduce my dependency on GUI for functionality, while having full simple attractive GUI access. It is fun for me accessing tiling for multi-tasking & learning Keyboard shortcuts to open, run & close apps. Hope I can learn enough to customize AntiX for what I would like to do which is centered around research,writing, photography, graphics, content creation communications.  Playing 'Real world games' would be fun but it’s not a priority. Look forward to installing AntiX on a Ryzen5 3600 w/nvme and 2old hdds and a new production box. I'm confident that I can customize AntiX with whatever utility apps prefer as a stable OS vs. a rolling update version.  AntiX can be run w/init.d, or sv,  32 or 64bit, pae or none-pae.  Very happy I took the time to run antiX live & then tried it installed to hardware, there is plenty of clear guides &  basic instruction for beginners.  Customization is up to you to gather information that suits your personal needs."

I don't know how to deal with them. I had to install it 3 times for my power off button to work. The whisker menu is not arranged alphabetically and confuses me. I can't access other partitions.

In order to make antiX viable you need about the same knowledge as you need to simply step up Debian,   Why not just take Ubuntu and add some apps and get what you actually want vs this half baked one foot in the water the other foot on the ground distro?antiX simply needs more refinement to be of service to novice users.   Sure antiX is light but in its weight class you can find superior distros like Q4OS or go lighter with Tiny or SliTaz.  "

572,2023-02-06, antiX, 22,10,23,"My review on antiX - I give it 10 from 10 for sure. First of all, antiX is a lightweight and systemd free Debian based linux distro, it's optimized for older systems as well as modern ones. It has been designed with the goal of providing users with an easy to use, fast and accessible OS.The main reason why I give antiX 10 from 10 is the fact that it does not rely on systemd like other Linux distributions do. Systemd slows down your system by a lot due to its complexity and unnecessary software components that are running in the background all of time. As such, you can have a better performance when running antiX since there won't  be any system process that you do not need or recognize. Another great thing about antiX is the fact that it comes with installation options for both full and minimal installations, so you can choose what works best for your requirements. Additionally, there are different versions of antiX available depending on your hardware such as 32-bit and 64 bit architectures which means that no matter what hardware platform you have - there will be a version suitable to run on it. Finally, its user interface makes navigation easy since all of the necessary applications are organized in categories making them easier to find thus increasing productivity when using the system."
573,2022-12-08, antiX, 22,8,14,I've tried many light distros for a few years in order to bring my old 2GB RAM netbook alive. Almost all have shutdown (power down) problems but antiX worked perfectly on that. I observed some stability issues on wireless connection sometimes nevertheless they are very rare. Users can choose some alternative applications as console based or visual based for some system settings. As they advertised this distro is for both old and new machines compatible. Thus it does not always come with the lightest options like some tiny distros. For example it comes with Firefox esr by default.
574,2022-12-03, antiX, 22,2,1,"Good-It supports 32 bit machinesBad-The GUI is very complicated -repetitive apps installed like video apps it has 2 video apps preinstalled that is not required.-Performing simple copy commands on the GUI results in 5 button options.

The default one, IceWM has so many costumizations and helper apps that looks and feels almost like a full blown Desktop Environment (except for some minor quircks)On the minus side: - The default File Manager (rox-filer) may be too strange for regular computer users (thankfully it's easy to change the default File Manager to zzzfm) - it lacks a real ""App store"" (Package Installer only offers some essential apps, for all the rest you depend on the not so newbie friendly Synaptic) - It lacks support to ""snaps"", because snap depends on systemd and, to save resources, antiX is systemd free - it lacks, out of the box, support to flatpaks - but you can install and configure flatpak- but running and managing flatpak applications can be tricky, without easy GUI's- so you should only use them if you are confortable around the terminal - it's prone to have sound problems- since antiX does not include pulseaudio by default, some apps, like Firefox and Chromium derived apps may not have sound. As a workaround, you can launch those apps from the terminal with the perfix ""apulse"". To really solve those problems, simply install pulseaudio (available from the Package Installer) - It lacks a menu search option, to find installed apps (but comes with an excellent program to locate and find applications: app-select, available from the pinned menu entries) - It has many menu entries- that can make new users fell it's ""too bloated""."

Hardware support is generally good. Forum support is good, but do your research first! I recommend the full version, although the base version works great out of the box too.But antiX is not for everyone. antiX does not use a mainstream desktop environment (such as KDE or GNOME). Instead, it uses a combination of file managers and window managers. The default setup is Rox file manager and IceWM window manager. This system is part of the reason antiX is lightweight. There are other file and window managers available, and over 10 preconfigured combinations of these, found in the Desktop menu. Sure, you can install Xfce and whatever desktop environment you want, but that kind of defeats the purpose. If you want that, use a mainstream distro. antiX is systemD free, which places some limits on what you can do, such as installing snap.

IceWM being the default gives a Windows-like experience for newcomers, and the built-in software from the ""Full"" option gives more than enough for the novice. Built-in encryption in the installer is also a huge bonus, though I did not take advantage of it this time around due to hardware limitations. The only issue I had, was that on the 32-bit version of AntiX, sometimes installing or uninstalling applications causes the ""Applications"" menu to blank out. My workaround is to use the menu editor in the control centre, and enable or disable and option, which seems to refresh the config file. If this bug could be fixed (maybe also add a ""Rebuild Menu option""?) then I would give this a 10/10 easily. This doesn't seem to happen on the 64-bit version of AntiX which I am using on a modern laptop. Thanks for bringing new life to this little guy! 9.9/10!"

This particular laptop has an obscure wifi card that is not supported even on the non-free Debian iso.. AntiX found and enabled the wifi card, no problem. Plus it still offers the legacy Nvidia-340 drivers and it was literally one click install from the settings. AMAZING.I liked the control panel and tools it includes. The ability to create a bootable ISO from the current installation is life saving. This distro blows the competition away for old 32bit computers.

With Linux, you should firstly Google, check some Linux forums and only then post your questions. But with Antix you'll find that the majority of recipes isn't working and upgrading packages from debian backports (at least in 19.5) with quickly break your system: you won't be able to launch any web-browsers except for seamonkey. Another pain in the ass was pulseaudio. I've used it in many distros. e.g. Arch. Slackware. Ubuntu. But here it simply doesn't work. It loads, it kinda starts, but you need to switch profiles manually every time you start something, that works with audio, like audacious/mpv. Without that, you'll get silence after boot. And i did everything that was mentioned in forum posts, config files. Still no sound. I've switch (temporarily) to Arch. Install bare-bones ICEWM + pulse and everything works flawlessly. Zero problems whatsoever. There are a lot of broken dependencies, like in antix 21 x64 you'll not be able to install wine after upgrade. At least I wasn't able. And adding wine repo didn't help me.

I can even work on this laptop with Firefox and LibreOffice simultaneously without dipping into Swap. However, a lighter web browser than Firefox might be necessary when working for a longer time with several files and applications. (SeaMonkey is the default web browser.)To keep it slim, I chose Base version, which installs with good app alternatives for almost all of the jobs I want to perform. But office packages were absent.There is a repository of 165 GUI packs and 84 cmd-line packs. AbiWord, Gnumeric and others installed automatically with menus in my (non-English) language, but LibreOffice came in US-English with only my national settings installed.

The default is IceWM/Rox, but besides being slow that setup was not always fitting onto my netbook screen (odd screen size, of course). AntiX fouind and set up my WiFi no problem. It provides a control center that is pretty clunky compared with KDE, but usable, I was able to reset menu programs with it which can be tricky with lightweight window managers, usually requiring finding/editing the configuration file. And as a Debian-based distro you do have access to the full repository of Debian. I also like that it sets up separate user and root passwords, a lot of Debian-based distros do not do that.

I opted for the minimum install to see what was considered minimum. Even though it included additional things to what I consider minimum, I can only surmise it's minimum compared to their standard install.Once installed, the login screen is down right ugly. The out of the box interface is also ugly and just bad. Like really, really bad. Tried to restore the stock KDE Plasma interface (theme and layout) but even that was a hassle. It didn't put the bar to the bottom and kept it on the right hand side. The Breeze Dark theme I selected yielded a half light, half dark  result. A reboot didn't fix it but I finally figured it out.

Manjaro runs at about 600MB and Solus maybe around 650MB on my HP i7 desktop with 16GB RAM but KaOS seemed to be at 1.1GB which was surprisingly higher. It may be pre-loading more into RAM to make it faster based on available RAM- who knows. I got the impression it is using XFS as the file system so that may be part of the reason why. The KaOS packages are somewhat limited to around 2100-2200 but should be enough for the average user. KaOS feels Solus to me but not as complete in some ways. Although, KaOS has a far better Welcome app to guide you through some initial settings and application installations versus Solus having nothing. As with Solus, some applications have to be started through the terminal like UnComplicated Firewall in Solus. On KaOS you do the same thing for Telegram which seems strange. Once it is started - the icon is in the Internet menu and you can pin it to the task bar. I like KaOS. It has curated packages that work far better than some Snaps/Flatpaks like what Solus does. There is not much to dislike. However, there are a few things I like more in Manjaro/Solus Plasma. KaOS has a good implementation of the Plasma desktop ONLY and I may keep it on my SSD - it is running very well and I am pleased with it. There are many things to like about KaOS. If you are proficient with the terminal and/or like using the terminal more, than KaOS is fantastic. If you want a GUI mostly, there will be occasions you need to use the terminal. If you dislike the terminal, then I think KDE Neon with Plasma, Solus Plasma, Manjaro Plasma, or Kubuntu is a better choice. (You won't avoid the terminal entirely with those distributions but use of the CLI will be less.)

630,2021-02-14, KaOS, 2021.01,8,0,"KaOS is a very good KDE-focused distro with one of the best looking KDE themes (Midna and MidnaDark) although yes - some icons for GTK apps are missing.KaOS uses the Pacman packaging system from Arch Linux but with their own repositories with hand-crafted selection of apps plus user-maintained apps built from source in KCP. They work flawlessly but the selection is rather limited. I was able to add software-rich repositories from Arch Linux to Pacman in KaOS (except ""core"" due to name collision) and a lot of additional apps from Arch can indeed be successfully installed and used in KaOS but, unfortunately, due to some incompatibilities not all - e.g.  those based on webkit2gtk like GnuCash which I've been using and is essential for me. That's why I would appreciate if KaOS developers made their distribution compatible with Arch like e.g. Manjaro does - it would not have to interfere with their proclaimed focus on KDE but only added additional option for users who need additional specific apps and would like to use KaOS as their main all-round distro."
631,2021-01-21, KaOS, 2021.01,9,0,"Really good and nice looking distro. As an occasional linux user, and still a beginner, I was really impressed after first boot up. Not really by the panel on the right (that looked weird actualy) but unique wallpaper and white design.KaOS still needs a lot of polish, mainly in midna theme. Its a beutiful theme, but incomplete. You cant see some icons on white backgrounds and some icons were replaced by some that doesnt even make sense. Its a small thing, but developers should really fix this. If you change theme to Breeze, all the icons are visible and correct, but then you will lose that unique and beautiful midna theme.If it wasnt for this ""incomplete"" midna theme, and badly scaled panel on the right (I mean, the panel on the right side is actualy cool idea, I got used to it pretty fast, and now Im using panel on the right on every distro even on windows - thx KaOS) but they should pay some more attention to these small details to have a distro that does feel polished.Small tweak like changing panel thickness to 50 makes so much more difference. It should be like that as default after first boot. That would make much better first impression for new users.There are also some other things that needs some attention, but I was quite alright using this distro. Pacman is well implemented and what you cant find there you can use KCP for some other apps, and if not there, use flathub. You will have to use terminal for that, but its pretty simple and elegant.Its still one of my favorite distros, and I hope that they will fix these small things so I can give it 10/10.Oh, and btw... its infernally fast and lightweight."
632,2021-01-16, KaOS, 2021.01,7,0,"Usually test this on a spare drive because I'd like to use it. Occasional hiccups have kept it off my main drive, however. Liked learning how to use KCP, that made me a better user. We'll see how the latest rendition goes.Good implementation of Octopi, but anything on the ""alien"" side of things can cause issues. Kaos has the most useful and beautiful welcome screen I know of. So much spit and polish!Solus KDE is just too good on my hardware to replace it with Kaos. Solus has enough of the freshness but non of the headaches.

Currently running the 06-07-2023 release. The only things I ran into that are show stoppers is the fact that you don't get to set your user password as the root password or create a root password during the install. That they created their own version of RootActions which is truly worthless which one must replace through Pamac cause trying to add it through Dolphin Dolphin ask for the root password which the devs either created themselves and are not sharing or never added one. The fact that when one calls this to their attention that they never tell the user the root password tells me that they not only blocked the user from creating a root password but didn't set one themselves. 
641,2023-06-24, BigLinux, 2023-04-11,10,3,"BigLinux is a fantastic distribution. It's hard to think of better ones. It is very affordable and elegantly well built. The fact that it is based on Manjaro/ArchLinux makes it even more interesting, because as it is rolling-release, no one needs to finish annual or semi-annual updates. Anyone, even without any programming knowledge, can use it easily. The list of pre-installed apps makes the distro very user-friendly. The distro's motto is ""striving for perfection"". Its developers seem to struggle to achieve this goal."

I think some of the problems Manjaro was having were overblown and it is still a solid distribution. BigLinux just makes some minor things easier and provides some good default layouts. Unlike other distributions whereby you spend a little bit of time to considerable time tweaking and adjusting things, I have not done that with BigLinux. I am really happy with it and contemplating removing some of the other distributions I am using - but not Mint which to me is the most reliable and flexible OS.Biggest pros for BigLinux are ease of installation, the layouts option, the pamac GUI package manager, the additional curated list of programs, and the nature of it being a rolling release.The one negative is Manjaro’s self induced delay on some packages which might cause a problem if you also use packages from the AUR whereby dependencies are not delayed creating the potential for a break in the OS. I am exploring the idea of switching to the Testing Branch repositories to avoid that 2-week testing delay that Manjaro does in order prevent potential breaks due to mismatch problems with dependencies in the AUR. But, I only use one package from the AUR so it may be a moot issue.I am glad I stumbled upon BigLinux. Fast, rolling, and seems stable/solid. 👍🙂"

644,2023-06-20, BigLinux, 2023-04-11,10,1,"I’ve been using Linux distros off and on since 2009, mostly Ubuntu based or Debian based. Have also used Mandriva, PCLinuxOS, OpenSuse and a few others. Recently my iMac from late 2015 lost support for newer versions of MacOS so I decided I would get an external SSD and install Linux to avoid the slow internal HDD of the iMac. So the search began for my next distro.I was going to just install Mint like I usually do, but then got caught up between Mint and LMDE and couldn’t decide. Then I came across a YouTube video about BigLinux and was hooked. The appearance, ease of use, vast software available, and the awesome different desktops available in seconds with just a couple clicks of a mouse. I’ve now been using for days and love it. It’s fast, works well, and is easy to navigate and manage. One minor issue solved via command line (key ring issue) and everything else is perfect. Detected all my Mac hardware, including the webcam, and didn’t have to figure out any workarounds for my hardware. Printer setup automatically, sound worked, Broadcom wifi worked out of the box. Can’t ask for more.This is a mostly unknown distro, but I’m so glad I stumbled across it. Simple install and the rest is easy."

Last December I got the end-of-life message for that!.  That's when I decided to switch to Linux.  I had a little experience with Ubuntu and was not happy to have to use a terminal.I found BigLinux by going to the DistroWatch Project Ranking and looking for the highest rated product that would work as a home office setup.  I loaded it and others onto disks to try out.  I tried about eight different disros on disks and BigLinux seemed the best...even better than the Manjaro it was based on.I installed Big Linux on my desktop with the hope of reviving it and using it as a home office machine. The install went smoothly and gave me a dual-boot option.  Printer and peripherals installed with no problem.  The installed software was more than enough to communicate with the office and write reports from home. I had one question that was quickly answered on the forum.The switch from Microsoft to Linux is now simple!  I thank the development team for making BigLinux and excellent out-of-the-box experience. BigLinux is fast and does not take up a lot of room. The variety of software gives me more than I need and a lot more to experiment with. Flatpak and AUR give more options.  Also, it is a nice-looking distro!  I am now starting to do some customizing. I was able to set up hot-corners like Windows and get most everything working similarly. A few of the office laptops have slowed down and are now staring to get Windows 10 end-of life messages, as well as messages saying they are not good enough to handle Windows 11.  The office manager wants to toss them; I will install BigLinux on them and take them back to the office."

It's like an improved Manjaro KDE.The distribution already comes with some very useful programs, AUR available by default and everything has been configured to offer a lot of information and customization options. It's a great distro for anyone who needs to manage and manipulate multiple files. All standard tools like text editor, terminal, settings panel, viewers and file editors are very good. But all these features and options end up causing some bugs.Most of the bugs I faced were related to the KDE environment and the distribution's own programs, like the app store, but they were easy bugs to fix and the system comes with tools to restore things to default."

After coming from Debian I was very impressed that I could install not-so-common apps from the GUI, and it would compile and install them automatically.  Installation of apps though the ""store"" app is incredibly easy, and there are many apps to choose from, from multiple repositories.  Just search the store, and most apps that you want (even less popular ones) are there.  I installed this on an old laptop, and it made the old machine usable again.  Windows on this hardware was just too slow, yet I can run Windows in VirtualBox under Linux with about the same performance as I was getting on the bare metal.This is a distro that is definitely worth a look.

They create a proper control center to made easy modifications on system. Change theme, custom interface (with previous layouts), add gimmics, it all was easy with big control center.They created a proper “app store” too. Big Store, was an application that index all repos of Manjaro, and private repo of biglinux, AUR, and flatpak (with possibility of adding Snap) at one simple store. Well, big store is kind of a regular store. Resuming, you search, you choose the application, put your keypass, and voilá, install app. Furthermore, you can simplify searching on the big store, find only the “most important” app linked with the name that you search.Biglinux is a rollling release distro based on Manjaro. Bruno, the developer, created a great system that, certainly, have to be recognized. It is a great work, with an incredible community.

676,2022-01-08, BigLinux, 20.04-rc1,10,27,"Bem quero já colocar aqui a minha impressão geral sobre o BigLinux, mas referente à nova base manjaro que está por ser lançada ainda. Bem, iniciai ouso ainda na versão 20.04 base Ubuntu e já me senti bastante encantado com o sistema. Logo iniciei uso experimental da base manjaro e já se tornou definitiva há meses. É uma distribuição que possui muitas alternativas de personalização em todos os aspectos. É de uma beleza e suavidade bastante simples. É fluídica tanto na alternância de janelas e aplicações quanto na estrutura de sistema. Também encontrei na central de controle, personalizada da distribuição, alternativas bem divididas, e com bastante informação inclusive com auxílio de balões de ajuda. A combinação de cores, as possibilidades de uso de aplicações de diversos formatos, a quantidade de alternativas de aplicações. Também fiquei impressionado que antes, as distribuições que usava, travavam muito e o BigLinux não trava e nem tem retardo nas operações de abertura de aplicações fechamento de janelas. Eu sei que isso acaba sendo detalhes, mas no cômputo geral contribui muito o desempenho do sistema. A equipe que dá suporte à distribuição, no canal do Telegram (@BigLinux) é um pessoal bastante solicito, facinhos de nos tornarmos amigos. Tem também um diferencial neles que são muito cuidadosos no trato com os novatos, por que geralmente você encontra ulguns cabeções bastante irritantes que acabam prejudicando a difusão e adoção do linux pela falta de trato. Na equipe do BigLinux os caras são bastante atenciosos e querem mesmo é resolver o seu problema, procurando resolver logo o problema ou em alguns casos conduzir a solução para o fórum do grupo. Minha nota? Claro que é dez (10)! Se tivesse nota mais alta seria ela. Parabéns ao mantenedor (@bigbruno - Bruno Gonçalves) e à equipe que dá suporte."

It's a very comfortable OS in that it's very pretty and relatively easy to use - the developers clearly put ease of use in the forefront of their minds when it comes to customization and making applications / settings easily accessible.  You'll notice it immediately when installing the OS to your machine.I did experience a bug that I brought to the developers attention that caused the system to freeze when showing some inspirational quotes prior to login.  Seems to be resolved now, and I have not experienced it since.  The Community was quick to help and are overall bright, helpful and delightful to work with.Overall, if you're comfortable using Ubuntu or anything Ubuntu based, you'll feel right at home with BigLinux.Keep in mind that BigLinux will be based off of Manjaro moving forward - I'm happy for them and the project, but I don't personally like using Rolling Release distro's.

hello really good linux distribution. I've tried many but this one works perfectly. It is a Gentoo-based then as startup it uses Open-Rc which in my opinion is faster and more stable than the Systemd tradition used by the various linux distributions. To update you need to run the cl-update command from the terminal. But now I've been using this distribution daily for a long time and I feel great.Then emrge works much better than Fedora and Ubuntu's DNF and APT. I believe that in the future I won't change my reference distribution anymore"

I installed the ISO with KDE, but i am switching to wayland, and no problem at all. Audio is the only problem that i am having, but, it's a general problem and it's happening to every distro (my graphics card isnt helping at all, bruh).I don't recommend using if you are a newbie to the linux world, it may be more hard to you to learn about it, but it's worth the challenge - i think.

Using KDE Plasma and I am very happy.Everything just works and works well. It is a very tight system.I did use Gentoo earlier this year for about a month. That experience helped me in understanding Calculate better. It is not a requirement to use Calculate but you get invaluable experience in understanding Portage.My hands down best feature is that I can run Windows 10 in VirtualBox and I get an almost bare metal experience. I can barely notice the difference. Very happy that I do not have to dual boot anymore. When I need Windows, my work gets done and done.Videos are crisp and tear free, audio is perfect using Pipewire.Libreoffice is fast.I am not a gamer so I cannot offer any experiences on that score.Very happy and recommend you try a bare metal install of Calculate. Portage is a command line only package manager. There is a learning curve. Just use cl-update -c and your system will update and clean obsolete packages from your system.Try it, set it up and forget it. Your distro hopping days will be over."

Plus you can control how packages are installed with USE flags, Gentoo way.Calculate linux has thousands binary packages, so you don't have to waste time compiling from source.And it's fast as wind.

The live environment was really friendly, but the installer was kind of confusing. I managed to install it with the help of the project's useful documentation. I first used the XFCE edition on an old desktop, and then used the KDE version on a modern laptop. Calculate  reallly makes Gentoo easy to use, because it comes with many useful applications out of the box, it uses binary packages so you don't need to wait for hours until the packages compile and it has friendly graphical utilities to update the system etc. The packages in the repositories are  in the latest version(most of the time)and they are stable too. If you are coming from MacOS or a MacOS-like Linux distribution, you are going to feel right at home as Calculate offers a pre-configured desktop environment that looks like Apple’s operating system. To use the Portage packaging system    you can type: “eix name_of_the_package” to find if it is available in the repositories and then type “(sudo)emerge name_of_the_package). If you want to install proprietary software, you can use flatpak, as it works very well with Calculate. The distribution overall feels very fast and responsive.I can feel the optimizations made for my hardware. All in all, Calculate is the perfect distribution to bring Gentoo to the masses and the desktop. I highly recommend Calculate if you want to give Gentoo Linux a try."

689,2022-06-06, Calculate Linux, 22,10,13,"TLDR: Calculate Linux is a fantastic choice, basically Gentoo on easy mode. The Desktop editions are a breeze to install. The Scratch edition is a little more complicated, but offers a truly customized and optimized operating system. I've been using Calculate Linux for daily desktop use as well as heavy duty scientific work for about four months at the time of this review. In that time it's proven to be the best operating system I've used. I'm using Calculate Linux Scratch on a workstation and desktop. The installation process was simple and took no more than ten minutes. While Calculate offers a variety of well tested and stable desktop environments, I opted for the minimalist Scratch edition and built up exactly the system I wanted. Calculate Linux has a well supported repository of binary packages, but software can also be compiled through emerge with custom USE flags ala, Gentoo. This is great, especially for scientific libraries which need to be optimized for the specific hardware on which they're running. In this way, Calculate offers the advantages of pure Gentoo, namely customized and optimized applications when you need it, but without the downside of pure Gentoo, i.e. long compile and update times. This distribution has been developed and maintained since 2009 and has had ample time to mature into a very stable and usable system This is evident in the included Calculate Utilities, which are quite functional and beneficial in installing, modifying and maintaining the operating system. Management of sound and graphics cards is made easy. Perhaps the strongest aspect of Calculate is the community and support. There is a strong user presence on Calculate Linux social media and chat media such as Telegram. The developers and maintainers are active participants and very willing to answer questions. If I had to identify downsides to Calculate Linux, I would say the online documentation isn't the best, and I have frequently resorted to the Gentoo wiki instead. While the Desktop editions are very easy to install, the Scratch edition is more involved, and might be too much for a novice user. Installed on:Workstation:AMD Ryzen 3950xAsus Prime x-570Seagate Barracuda NVMERTX-2070 (with Nvidia drivers)Sound Blaster Audigy Laptop:2014 Dell Latitude Core i5Intel GraphicsCrucial Mx500 SSD"
690,2022-04-05, Calculate Linux, 22,10,5,"Perhaps the only linux that puts together all three of (1) complete system easy-to-install, fast, and ready to use, (2) very large selection of packages with selectable options for professional developers or students and overlays available for adding very broad / latest haskell and math/science support, (3)  choice of nicely configured and tested desktops.  From the installer you can choose either Alsa or Pulseaudio/Pipewire.  I like the gnome flavor which is released by Adrien Linuxtricks (cldga.linuxtricks.fr).  It's a really solid Gnome.  Caveats:  you install packages from the command line using eix to search and emerge to install, just as you would do in plain Gentoo Linux.  And you configure package options by setting USE flags in a text file (/etc/portage/package.use/custom) just as you would do in plain Gentoo Linux.  Calculate installs pre-built binaries when it can or builds from source transparently when it needs to.  If you don't want to ever see the command line then maybe use Deepin Linux.  If you need to do development or some kinds of professional work then you would enjoy the power of Calcuate.  Unlike my experience with plain gentoo, with Calculate software updates have always been reliable and trouble free.Works great with either Plasma Desktop or Gnome Desktop for me for years now."

This machine is booted and ready in less than 3 seconds and runs as fast (if not faster) than my $2000+ Dell XPS 15 laptop.Updating is easy if you just want to use one command: cl-update. This updates your OS and cleans obsolete packages etc. If you find that boring you can learn emerge.Also has a built in automated update check utility.The Calculate Console tool has more useful tools built into it than I care to write about here. It's really awesome. Kinda reminds me of the Yast control panel in Open Suse. very useful indeed.It's made in Russia. Just like the Vostok Amphibian watch, this thing is built to endure and deliver.

695,2021-04-16, Calculate Linux, 20.6,9,8,"I agree with the person below, this is a grossly overlooked distro that’s been around like for ever. In response to another comment here, and like the now defunct and also great Sabayon, the nightly images are not recommended since they often pose issues after installing. By far the best approach is to take the official release and install from scratch. Yes this will then take some time to update but  the result will be worth the wait and afterwards being Gentoo based the installed system will be faster than anything else you have used previously.Multimedia including video thumbnails play out of the box so there’s no need to hunt for codecs. Installing other stuff is as easy as typing ‘emerge-’ followed by the name of the package you want.In many ways the Russian distros have always been near the top for desirable products but due to Covid and the general economic climate ROSA and Alt are struggling with the former looking like going under. Hopefully Calculate will not become another victim.Lastly I always smile at the often displayed attitudes towards Russian distros because most of those I speak to think ReactOS (also Russian) is American. Go figure."

All three attempts were fruitless.  Network is fine, emerge will remove packages, but syncing and trying anything else it fails.  No error output or anything, just doesn't respond.  The reason I tried xfce to see whether their gui updater has any fixes/setups that make it work.

I wanted to try AcademiX to see what it has to offer as a distribution designed to educational purpose.I don't know why every time I see a distribution with educational in mind it's always shipped with Mate as the default desktop environment. They explain on their page that it's to be low on resources while still being user friendly. I'm not a big fan of Mate and would have preferred Xfce but that's only a personal preference.Pros - Well polished with many preinstalled themes- easy to find educational applications with the ""EDU"" installerCons- The iso is old and still based on Debian Buster, if you don't know how to use Debian you really are going to have old stuff- Some added repos are getting error messages when trying to update in command line (seems to be a recurrent problem by seeing on their website)- No audio or video reader preinstalledNot the most mind blowing distro out there, regarding the educational purpose it does the job with ""EDU"" but it stops there. It's definitely not the most user friendly, if you don't know how Debian works you might find some difficulties to use it correctly. Since its main goal is educational, I would have liked to see some stuff regarding Linux/Debian but I haven't found anything."

Freespire does the one thing all OS should aSPIRE to do:  get the ... out of the wayThe user should not really notice the OS, except to say, good job OS.IDK what freespire (perhaps benefiting from the professional version, Linspire, there being a pro version; i think it's just support though, but don't quote me; the idea is that they get paid to make Linspire work, and they give you the same stuff for free but without the support, ie help from actual ppl in real time, etc.)The KDE is good, i got it doing what i want, mostly (left bar, button bottom, tray top, tasks middle, but it won't do half transparency when mouse leaves, like XFCE, so I'll be switching to xfce, or adding it in).  I'm even getting used to the single click, like it more.  It's odd though, not always single click.  I think it's kind of a apple/mac thing, the single click, so i don't mind not using it.  Probably just use xfce and not look back.Been a couple of weeks with this so far and it's great.  Just no hiccups, no headaches, no hassle.  Why should it be a hassle?  lolSo, two doors, one says ""hella big hassle"", the other door says ""freespire"".lol.to be fair, ubuntu works well; this is not ubuntu exactly.  IDK what 'spyware' might be embedded in it, as someone said, but I'm not finding anything to complain about, at all.  Except for that taskbar transparency thing, lol.  Also, the login manager (as when coming out of sleep/standby) is a bit ugly and irritating, have to punch keyboard and whack mouse to get it to show password input field.I did install ""ubuntustudio-installer"" and all that, which is why i decided on an ubuntu base.  Works good."

For my needs I'm pleased it includes Calligra Office, Flatpak and Balena Etcher. It's also faster than most I've installed with a lower resource usage rate. I just installed the MX Conky Manager to have access to their range of themes. Nice logo and default wallpaper."

It used to be a good Linux distro many years back when the original developers made it an independent distro and not based on anything and including custom tools to make it very simple and easy to use. It was back in the days of Xandros and such and when more Linux distros were more difficulty to use and heavily relied on the terminal. But all of that image of a great distro has faded away when another company bought Freespire and Linspire and made it another bloated, slow and buggy Ubuntu clone. The real only difference here is themes, some different applications and different wallpapers. It baffles me why there are so many Ubuntu clones that keep its spyware and just modify the look and feel."

Memory usage was only 448mb and the install was fast an easy. Make sure to enable third party hardware support during install. Had no issues with printers or wifi.It doesn't include codecs, so be sure to install the Ubuntu restricted extras to get them. The only glitch I ran into was, there's no package manager available other than the app store. They have Synaptic installed but there's no icon and after searching for the app and running it, it denies authentication. I ended up installing Muon package manager to test, and it worked. So I used it to install Synaptic, the icon showed up and it ran just fine. You could also try to reinstall Synaptic with the app store but I chose not to do that. I added LibreOffice and a few other apps and was ready to go. If you are regularly using Google apps you will love this distro but its a very balanced distro.Being based on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS you have a huge amount of apps to chose from as well as access to Snap apps. Give this distro a try as XFCE has improved greatly and is easy to use.Many choices for appearance and the ability to customize the desktop.

You know, there is nothing really special about Freespire, just anohter Ubuntu based distro with XFCE, it´s like an ""alternative"" version of Xubuntu.But, hey, it works well, has a nice selection of wallpapers, nice icons and it´s ideal for that poor PC that you have in the garage. Not bad at all."

I was curious to try Budgie and Deepin, but I couldn’t keep it as a desktop environment that I’d want to use again, both Budgie and Deepin are bloated, unstable, crash a lot and take up a lot of ram while idle and of course even more when any applications are running, I saw 2 GB at minimum for both while running a couple tabs in Firefox, which isn’t the browser’s fault, but how heavy Budgie and Deepin are as desktop environments.With KDE and LXQt, they are very customizable, lightweight and have more full features applications so you can get done day to day work.I recommend ExTiX, but only the KDE and LXQt desktop environment versions."

Older hardware is often restricted to USB 2 which can be as slow as booting from optical media in a lot of cases, so I decided to install it on an old Phenom machine.Oh dear! They've opted not to use the standard ubiquity installer and used some weird custom jobbie, that starts in a terminal with a warning not to close this till the install is finished. It took a while to get to the next part and I was beginning to think it had crashed it was taking that long. There was no option to use the entire disk but gparted was provided to make your own partition(s) I opted to install a bootloader but it didn't work. Luckily I'd made a mistake and the old OS (MX Linux) was still intact and I was able to update grub to include it in the menu.Bottom line - as a live USB fine, as an installed distro, also pretty good if you can get past the archaic install process and get it to boot."

I have tried many different Linux OSes over the years on an old desktop, and I keep coming back to Endless because it just works with very little tweaking, includes easy installation of real Chrome, and is quite snappy on an older machine. I use and like Chromebooks too, and to me Endless is very similar in operation and benefits. My printer, which is often a problem on many distros, just worked instantly. My secondary storage drive just appeared and worked. My wifi just worked. Everything was good to go.Cons: Not for power users, and since the interface is not like Windows some may find it takes a little learning time. If you are used to a Chromebook it will seem quite similar in many ways."

Although the App Center itself is slow and can hang for a while after install/delete (more on it later).The read only root file system means you can't install anything outside of the App Center, and can't really break anything by your own actions, at least not without deep linux knowledge to know how to break it.Now the bad parts.I have an old NVIDIA graphic card - GeForce 770 and Wayland driver is not available for this card, so I often had freezes and graphical glitches, for example in Anki, the hardware acceleration was not working either. But switching to Xorg at login manager didn't help, maybe because it was not using the proprietary driver? It's hard to tell, because you can't really use apt to install anything, and nvidia was not found in the App Center. I think the hardware detection and driver installation could be better.The OS does not include any DNS filtering or parenting control by default so the 'bad' sites are fully accessible.Endless OS 5.0.4 (May 2023) still doesn't support black theme in Gnome. Gnome itself is very limiting, I had to write configuration to .profile (which you can do since it's in a user home folder not the root fs)Because you can't install anything which is not available in the App Center if this OS is broken for you out of the box it's very difficult to fix it, even if you know your way around other, traditional linuxes.For some reason some apps were not available for me in the App Center - vscode(ium), vim, emacs. But I could find and install them from the flathub site, after which they started to show in the App Center.App Center is too slow and buggy, it takes ~3-6 second for search. No availability to install with right click from the list of found apps, you have to go to each app page and install from there, but it takes ~5 seconds per each page load.----If you don't have an old nvidia card and want to explore the pre-installed apps in an Offline setting it can be OK'is choice, for anything else I would not recommend it."

733,2023-01-30, Endless OS, 4.0.10,10,3,"Im actually using version 5 and its  amazing. Easy to install, easy to use, it auto updates and its an immutable OS(core system files are read only) so you dont have to worry about having issues. Installing apps with Flatpak is as easy as a single click, and the basic install for me was the better choice as you can also use it as a live media session if you just want to try it without installing. Under the hood its still pretty much Gnome and it has all the typical settings but no Gnome tweaks and no real way to change the appearance or use other themes. That said it has a beautiful desktop that is very quick on older hardware. All my printers, wifi and laptop dock were seen and installed. Installing is so easy anyone can do it and their choice of apps even with the basic version is excellent. It wont take you long to adapt to the interface if you havent used Gnome before and for mobile, social media or online multimedia its an excellent choice.I would avoid the larger isos that caqn go as large as 17gb as they have a lot of apps you probably wont use and can install later. Even the basic install is 3.3gb so if you have a slow connection its going to take awhile.For mainstream/new Linux users this is an OS that will just work and allow you to do more and not have to fiddle with the OS.Definitely an OS for those who want to crossover from Windows and have a seamless experience.Advanced users will probably hate this OS as there is no apt/apt-get and Flatpak is your only option. Being immutable you cant fiddle with this OS and have to accept it for what it is and work with it. One of the best OS experiences Ive had in quite some time, try it."

At first try one might think it's a little bit limited, but that's not true if you take a look under the hood.1. It's based around Flatpak with no other way of installing software. Might sound limiting, but you can use Podman to run any Distribution alongside and have them running the software you need.2. The Root Filesystem is Read-Only and based on OSTree (the first mainstream Linux to do so). Yes you can't do any changes to the core files, but that a great thing in the end, as you get a atomic operating system which also can't be changed by some malicious software or by accident. Additionally, thanks to conforming to the XDG standard, most things can also accomplished user-wide via configuration files in your home directory.3. It supports NVidia cards OOB with either the proprietary driver for supported cards or nouveau for older ones.4. The UI is built with some GNOME Extensions which add useful features, making your device a real workhorse.5. It's completely open source, even the build tools are available over at Github6.

Kali Linux is the best pentesting Linux distribution I have ever tried.(Even better than BlackArch)The default desktop environment is really nice-looking and it has so many tools included out of the box, more than you will ever need for penetration testing. I also greatly appreciate the fact that the Metasploit framework is included out of the box, as I love using it to exploit EternalBlue(MS17-010) to hack Windows 7 and earlier versions of Windows. It is also great from daily use. I do not recommend Kali to beginners, but for somewhat experienced users who appreciate Debian and like or want to get started with penetration testing, it is one of the best options out there."
746,2023-03-16, Kali Linux, 2023.1,10,0,I love kali machine Because of following reasons.- cool name used for this distro- I love the count of tools- Kali wallpapers always motivate me to try harder- It's command suggestion on terminal is really cool- I love customizations of interface with kali- Startup and shut down speed are so good- I feel like achieved something on every attack- I like timely updates and upgrades- No excessive internet data usage. - No issues with virtual machines. works fantastic.- All things perfect
747,2023-01-16, Kali Linux, 2022.4,10,0,Kali is great for USB persistent in offering great network and security features. It boots up fast and benefits all the software/libraries as an Ubuntu based.USB persistent allows to run Linux on your existing hardware without touching any existing partitions/boot loaders of your default system operating system. No worry of installation process and overwritten UEFI partition or so whatever.You can easily create your USB persistent from the downloaded ISO using rufus under windows or mkusb under Linux or similar.

749,2022-02-21, Kali Linux, 2022.1,10,0,"This is perfect for its use case, nothing else even comes close.Great UI. Fast. Stable. Has useful tools. Customizable without much effort. Well documented. Perfect for when you just want to get work done and don't want to have to mess around with setting things up. It really is the first of its kind, and head and shoulders beyond anything else out there. One thing I like in particular is the documentation is very well structured. Whenever I need to look up how to do something, I can find it. Plus the multiple device support is really strong, I am hard pressed to name another Linux that has as strong of ARM support. That's not to mention the docker, WSL, cloud images, and so on. It's pretty nice to just have Kali out there and accessible to me no matter where I am. Its nor for general purpose use, and that's fine. This is a specialized tool for a specialized job role and it's great for that. At its core it is Debian however and so can still be used for anything Debian can be used for, which is pretty cool. I tend to start with a new install each time I go to use it, so I am always setting it up from scratch. Install goes nice and quick, and I don't have issues with that at all. I have had issues in the past with mirrors not being in sync, but really I get that with anything I use. I have tried other security focused distros before and they were so/so really. Did not really see anything I liked more in them, and they just did not seem very stable compared to Kali. Some seemed to just take Kali packages and change the UI (for the worse). Not really useful, so I just stick with the main thing. "
750,2021-12-07, Kali Linux, 2021.3,5,2,Bloated with software...overkill. Unless you're into administration and security testing this would not make a good daily driver. Both appearance and aesthetics leave much to be desired. Plus excessive RAM at idle which seems to be one of the downfalls of distros of the past 5 years. The download section of their website is VERY confusing to say the least! For a distro which has been in development for the past 17+ years Kali Linux really needs to go back to the drawing board and do a complete overhaul of their OS. Need I say more?  
751,2021-08-14, Kali Linux, 2021.2,10,0,"I have numerous computers and two of them are Raspberry Pi's.  One runs Kali as I am slowly learning System Admin on Linux and Pen-testing. I have tried Ubuntu in a Virtual Box on my PC, The other Pi is running Raspian, or RaspberryPiOS or whatever they call it now. I installed ProxMox on a micro PC I was gifted with.  So I've a little experience with Linux. I also installed Parrot OS in a VM that I am using to work on hacking vulnerable machines from Vulnhub. I used the Kali machine as my main machine when my Windows PC crashed with a corrupted C drive earlier this year. My opinion? I like it, It is my go to machine when I'm working on Linux. I've only toyed with all the hacking toys it comes with but as far as the desktop and terminal, once I got a few extras installed it is nice.  Honestly can't list any Cons.  It's never pissed me off so nothing comes to mind. "
752,2021-07-02, Kali Linux, 2020.4,10,0,"Perfect for pentesting and ethical hacking. Comes with pretty much everything you will ever need pre-installed for both beginners and experts alike. Kali CAN be used as a daily driver, for example if you only have a single laptop to tote around from home and work, but it shouldn't be your daily if you can help it. If you're interested in getting into the world of cybersec there really isn't a better starting point than installing Kali."
753,2021-02-27, Kali Linux, 2021.1,10,0,"First of all let me state that this is a bit of a PSA as well as a review. Kali is meant to be run as a live system for those who engage in ethical hacking/pentesting. KALI LINUX IS NOT MEANT TO BE USED AS A DAILY DRIVER. Certain features enabled for various programs actuallyake Kali more vulnerable. If you're thinking about installing Kali as a daily driver or you're just new to Linux, this distro is not for you. Kali serves its purpose well hence the 10/10. Please if you're thinking about installing Kali just go for Ubuntu, Mageia, or even Arch. "
754,2021-01-31, Kali Linux, 2020.4,1,8,"If you like to fix things then you're going to love this distro -- it's broken!!!Where do I begin? Well, maybe you should know that the developers do offer a version aimed towards ARM based systems. For the layman, that means it's supposed to work out of the box on something as ""basic"" as a Raspberry Pi 4 with 8GB of memory and a good boot device like a Samsung 32 EVO plus SD card -- like mine! So you can't say my ""hardware"" is the problem (or else it probably wouldn't even boot). I can report that other OS's for the Raspberry Pi (& it's ARM processor) work just fine. But when I tried Kali (2020.4) it was so buggy that even the kernel support for sound and wired Ethernet only worked about half the time -- and that's after I spent over 3 hours updating! I mean, WTF?! Either I have a built in virus (in a Linux distro - ya, I know) or it's just plain crap. So I'll go out on a limb and say it's just plain crap given that I've had similar experiences on the x86 side too (obviously, with other hardware).Don't waste your time with Kali Linux. If you want to learn about networking there are far better distros (sources) out there to do that with. Just about every pre-packaged program on Kali can be obtained through other standard repositories on almost any other mainstream distro -- so you will have to learn a little more Linux to get them installed. Quite frankly, that's Kali's selling point - to learn something and yet, they've pre packaged all those ""tools"" for you where a novice might not need to learn so much. Talk about a dilemma! So if you don't quite understand networking or don't know about a backbone piece of software called Wireshark then don't make it worse for yourself with this distro. But like I said, if you're the kind of person who likes to fix things then by all means, go ahead and waste your time with Kali. (I doubt very many Linux Guru's will).

Quiet a nice little distro, very snappy, a heap of great software (plenty of choices} choose what you want, easy install, easy uninstall, use the lock down set up or standard. Just as fast as MX though by default, you must choose a password at install, this is better security and the way to go I believe for ALL distros. Wallpapers are very ordinary.red-shift continually changes settings every time you connect to a power source which is quite annoying, so I removed it completely.

It's easy to instal on a USB flashdrive, it's lightweight, very fast,  and I also like that it offers the option to choose to install Chromium or Firefox as your main browser. One of its main features, i.e. containerization provides isolation (whenever it's needed) that  protects the system from any sort infection that could be caused by malicious malware or viruses that might manage to get through, especially when browsing the internet. Further, it provides 4 package managers, namely, PKGget, SFSget, Appi and Flapi, and applications can be installed to the main file-system or in their own containers, which ever one prefers.  Its Easy Version Control,  makes it really convenient to take a snapshot of a session, or roll back to an earlier snapshot or version if the need arises - like the time I got into trouble, when I turned off my computer without realizing I hadn't finished saving the session completely during shut down. I still have quite a bit to learn about this distro before I can comfortably say that I'm good at it, but I'm enjoying my experience getting to know it a little better as each day passes.  and  I am hopeful whilst at the same time, certain that the developer, Barry Kauler, will to continue to improve this fantastic distro.   Thank you, Barry, for this wonderful experience!"

However, there is a download link built into the internet menu on EasyOS 5.0, which makes installing Firefox browser very easy - just have to remover the Chromium packages via menu SetUp Menu then ; )*As EasyOS is built to be a modernised & more secure version of Puppy Linux - I would be ever so grateful if someone could help Barry and release an online guide on how to set up a WireGuard connection to help further protect the users online privacy and security (eg: MITM attacks).

I installed version 4.3 and this latest version is much faster, very efficient and with very complete list of packages.For those like me using a drive-less computer (an old laptop with no hard disk), it is a very interesting distribution. It can run fully in RAM like its puppies cousins, but can also be run in RAM with the session saved on a thumb drive. It uses Joe Windows Manager (JWM) and no heavy desktop.  Look-and-feel is a little retro, but has progressed a lot since the Buster series of releases.What is amazing is the light containers technology included in this distribution, very easy to configure. Among the amazing things you can do with this distribution : run the latest Firefox browser, very very fast, in a pre-configured container for safety. Run LibreOffice or a Puppy linux distribution in a container if you want to. Alternatively, you can reboot in RAM and if you choose ""Copy session to RAM and disable drives"" you end up with the same distribution without containers, but with a lock-downed kernel with Zram already pre-configured. You can browse and do whatever you want, quite safely because the kernel is lockdowned (in confidentiality mode), and when you turn off the computer, it leaves no trace whatsoever.The only down side is that some versions of software are old.

I run both.Then there are all the great features, including the Puppy ones from remastering to a great drive formatter using cfdisk wrapped around a graphical interface (Gparted is also there), or an Easy speciality running applications (or even other Puppy or derived operating systems) in containers if you want (I don't have a need for that functionality, and found it slow when I tried it, but great to see it there). As in Puppy, lots of interesting tools worth exploring.Not many applications in the repositories yet but I haven't found the need to add anything anyway to what it is set up with. However, Firefox, Chromium and Ungoogled Chromium are all a click away if you want them (I prefer Seamonkey).Simple and minimal are overused cliches in computing, but EasyOS is both - this is a great system for someone who wants to use a desktop as it should be (not a server system modified).

I'm using 12.1.0.04. 12.3.0.4 wouldn't install but it not that big a problem. Overall I would recommend this for a file server. I tried to install Mint and just do a simple samba file share but despite reading over a dozen tutorials I could not get it configured and connected to my Windows machines. I looked at a few of the pure NAS OS's and tried a few without successful installation. I was able to get Xigmanas installed on an HP microserver and it worked well despite having only 4GB of RAM. It is just a simple file sharing server so nothing too taxing. I'm configuring another server with 32GB of RAM. My biggest complaint is that the GUI is not at all intuitive for someone without formal computer training. I have no computer training at all so I have to figure things out for myself. The online documentation is poor at best. If you are a computer person then I'm sure it all makes sense but for someone with none it's confusing. There are so many options and I have no idea what most of them mean. There should be some explanation of the multiple options available available through the WebGUI. There are some basic tutorials online but they are sparsely documented. I haven't been able to get a ZFS configured drive connected. I took 2 points off because of this and the documentation issue."

It was the first time I installed a BSD, but it was a breeze. The system and the Web-UI are pleasant to work with, simple and efficient yet powerful. The only critic I have is that some parts of the UI are not that intuitive (at least for me), like when you activate services or create/add new devices/arrays etc. - but overall the UI is well arranged and informative. And most important: your browser doesn't blow up because of ""modern UI"" JS crap.The documentation is also pretty good, although sometimes outdated. But for the most parted the user get's a good guide how to work with the system and do stuff.Another thing: the (idle) power consumption of the machine was significantly lower with XigmaNAS compared to Linux Distributions! Cool bonus. With additional advantages like native ZFS support XigmaNAS is a good choice for a NAS system.Conclusion: Recommended!"

This time I needed to deploy multiple servers (all three were different brands) quickly and had no time to experiment with different OSes. After quick research about existing NAS distros I decided to try XigmaNAS and was happy with my choice. I was able to build servers on time with no issues. I love this distro. It worked well and I hadn’t noticed any issues so far.Cons:-	Not very intuitive interface for inexperienced person. However when you learn and understand the way to configure drives, storage pools and services you will be surprised how easy to setup the server-	No accounts configuration option during the setup therefore you would need to remember to change passwords for root and admin accounts after the installationPros:-	Easy to install and configure if you are already familiar with the web interface and all available  options-	Great hardware compatibility-	Great ZFS implementation"

I use it extensively for about 4 years, mostly on virtual machines, but also on hardware. It is everywhere: at home, in the office, and in the cloud. I enjoy my home setup where I have a hardware server (RHEL 8) with multiple qemu-kvm virtual machines, one of which is my vyos router. And I don't have any other router at home. Connects everything with everything providing robustness, flexibility and ease of use. A complete solution for all routing needs, VPN, etc. A pure joy to configure and run. It's free to build and use. Highly recommended for professionals and amateurs alike.

During distro-hopping, I came across this distro which was not popular and it's unfair because it's a real gem. His package manager (upkg) is very simple and serves its purpose well : Install binary packages and build from sources. The installer is extremely simple and fast as the distro itself. The only problem I had is that install/build another kernel is quite hard cause some dependencies like fakeroot doesn't exist in repos, so if a drivers is not compatible you're going to be in a mess, and there is not a lot of package in binary (about 2000) but it include flatpak so you can install other packages easily.Overall this distro is a nice surprise
"
788,2023-07-15, Gentoo Linux, stable,9,1,"
The customization works nice for me. I don't want systemd as init and openrc, for me, might be the main advantage that gentoo has over other distros.Bein able to unconfigure (e.g. systemd-)dependencies wherever possible for all packages is a big plus.Compiling the system over again every x days of course is a bit tedious but I guess you can't have one without the other.My personal environment is very lightweight, so I don't use any Desktop Environments etc.; Luckily, for libreoffice there's a binary package, too. That leaves me with the main heavyweights llvm, firefox, rust and maybe clang that will take their time to compile. Basically, updating every 3 days overnight does the job for me.I would not trade the flexibility and most important freedom of choice that gentoo offers for a quicker install of packages, so I'm good.I also have to say that for now 10+ years, the rolling releases have cause little trouble for me. On some rare occasions I had to fix some reverse dependencies when updating in bigger intervals like 1 or 2 months. Apart from that, I feel like using the same config and system for over 10 years now quite reliably. Even to the point that I feel that my knowledge of system maintenance is fading because I never hve to bother with it."
789,2023-04-27, Gentoo Linux, stable,6,10,"I've been using Gentoo for just over half a year and it's been a mixed bag. The good--------------USEflags are great, how streamlined kernel customization and upgrading is is also great. The repositories have quite a good range of packages. The community is relatively helpful compared to others. eselect for wine is quite nice. I love being able to choose between stable and testing/unstable on a per-package basis. The choice of init systems is excellent too, OpenRC has given me 0 issues compared to systemd which would often hang for ~2min on every shutdown or restart on Arch and Debian, struggling to terminate something.The bad-------------Compiling every (mostly every, there binary versions of a scant few packages like firefox and thunderbird) is a chore. Yes, I can still do stuff while I'm updating, but I'm not sure the load on my CPU, my time, and the heat blasted into my house every time something like gcc or llvm needs updated is worth it. I'm happy to compile the things I actually care about and want to customize, but when simple dependencies take 15-30 minutes each in some cases, I dread updating. It prevents me from using some packages I otherwise would enjoy using, too. In some cases it's been a good thing, as it's pushed me to try alternatives (ie newsboat instead of akkregator or rssguard), in others it's just a pain. I quite like the Cinnamon desktop, for example, but if I wanted to use it, I would have to compile a second version of llvm, webkit gtk and spidermonkey which all have quite demanding compile times.Back to the repositories, I have begun to get the impression that Gentoo is lacking in working hands. It's not rare to come across packages in the official repos that mysteriously are without a maintainer, and have been for some time. I've also come across packages I used relatively frequently on other distros being bugged on Gentoo. Both of these things are quite a shame, because at first Gentoo felt very polished, and getting away from a lack of polish was part of why I ditched Arch for it. But overall, at this point, Arch might actually be more polished.I don't think this distro is worth the effort. In the future I'd like to see a distro that uses binaries by default but supports a USEflags-esque system for customizing and compiling the packages where I actually give a damn about them. Until then I will probably return to something that is less work and feels more supported in general, whether Arch or Debian (the next release of Debian in particular sounds excellent, but that is a few months away yet)"

Can be a steep learning curve yes, but once at the top it opens the world. Its versatility and capability are precisely what opensource intends at a fundamental level.The package manager (portage) is ""simply"" a high level control for a suite of compile scripts and operates much like pacman or apt at the basic level. Source code gets downloaded from the authors (git, url, or whatever, and therefore no worrying about the safety of 3rd party compile jobs) and everything gets automatically configured and compiled before your smiling eyes. Errors are generally well-explained and package updates include notices of significant upcoming changes and how to roll with them; usually also including the actual terminal commands to run.Package options are set in a text file. For example: selecting what codecs get compiled into ffmpeg. The defaults generally just work. Some major packages are also available as pre-compiled binaries (e.g. Firefox or Openoffice) if needed.Install specific package versions, retain versions (as long as all the libs are still there), install side-by-side versions (slotting), or compile your own. Obviously, all the tools are already there. Pull down some fun new toy from git and chances are good that you already have all the build dependencies.First install does take a while to compile but after that, monthly updates compile in an hr or less on a 8 core machine. New 16 core CPUs from both Intel and AMD can recompile the entire system in ~4hrs and that rarely needs to be done. I'm at 40gig disk use, but who has that problem anymore these days?I run openbox desktop with an AMD gpu. Ran Nvidia for a while and those proprietary drivers were just as easy to work with. Gentoo repositories keep up with recent NV releases. I'm using a mixture of testing and stable branches with zero problems. The documentation is well done and Arch help is generally compatible.I would buy this OS (kind of did!)."

Stable is very stable and much like Debian (stale IMO).  I use the zen kernel.

I am a rare gentoo user in that I use a lot of resource heavy software, like KDE Plasma, Virtualbox, Bottles, Systemd etc.  Working with ebuilds and modifying your own is not well documented, i.e. ebuild  manifest (or merge.)  Takes a lot of digging to find out where to store and how to install an ebuild.  Arch makes PKGBUILD a lot more friendly IMO.  Compile times in RAM work faster than on disk.  Overlays for things not in gentoo repos are fine but I prefer to copy the few I need to my local repo and modify the ebuilds to get newer  versions, etc.  Installing a rare git pkg from source or with python is sometimes necessary as Gentoo repos aren't the most robust. Larger root partition is a must as a lot of libraries and build dependencies will be installed; it will need at least double the space of binary distro for root partition.  All said, I am happy with it.  Not really the best distro for the average user.  Most users with be happy with a binary distro like Arch, *ubuntus, Debian, or Fedora.  Is it faster?  No,  not really.   Does it work well? It can depending upon the skill of the user.  Not a 10 as the documentation is lacking in many areas & definitely in need of a modern overhaul.

If I had not known that, I could have legitimately spent a few days stuck, most of it being the compile time. I tried using grub-install onto my boot partition, however, grub-install threw an error that could have caused me hours of re-installing. The message stated that I ran out of storage on my EFI Partition, and I thought that for a minute that somehow my 1 GB EFI Partition ran out of space. So, I deleted EVERYTHING in my boot partition and then installing the distribution kernel. After doing all that, the same exact issue happened. I eventually figured out that this issue actually was caused by me forgetting the ""--removable"" flag (as I stated earlier). If I didn't know the day earlier, I COULD have spent weeks figuring out the problem (I often completely restart the installation, assuming its my problem)  Second: I had was with the proprietary nvidia drivers.  So after installing nvidia-drivers and upon rebooting, my computer froze at the fsck check. For some reason, nvidia HATES ttys, however, I didn't know it when I was recently installing it, so I completely started over from scratch, spending 8 additional hours before coming to the realization that it was the nvidia driver. So I assumed it had to be something with the kernel configuration, as this happens to every linux distribution I use, so I hatched a plan to complete this. First was to install xorg and all the xorg drivers (the nvidia drivers will be installed), and then KDE. After installing SDDM and setting it up, this plan worked which is why I am able to be writing this review at the very moment.But after all of those issues, I still find myself ONLY wanting to use Gentoo. Yet, after hours of trouble, I still wanting to use Gentoo only. Most distributions I use, personally, aren't very stable. I feel like Gentoo somehow (after the trouble I went through to get it running) is quite stable. However,  I would never do another re-install of Gentoo (this was a re-installation) until I have to."

799,2022-10-12, Gentoo Linux, stable,7,17,"Gentoo Linux is a great distro that is very customizable. Gentoo allows users to customize their kernel and packages installed onto their system. Gentoo also supports a variety of hardware architectures, allowing users freedom to choose their hardware. Gentoo can speed up an old system or low end system. Gentoo is also good for running a specific task, such as a game server, due to its lightweight design. Gentoo does come with some difficulties, especially for new people. Gentoo's compile speed will depend solely on your hardware, this isn't Gentoo's fault as Gentoo allows you to compile packages from source, however, binary packages can be installed for large packages. Gentoo's repository is small, meaning that not many packages or up to date packages will be found. Gentoo can easily be broken, again not Gentoo's fault, but a warning for newbies who want to install Gentoo. Gentoo does follow the ""With great power comes great responsibility"" philosophy, it is easy to break the system, however, if used right, can be a great experience. I personally wouldn't run Gentoo on a high end workstation, as compiling from source wouldn't show any noticeable performance improvements."
800,2022-10-05, Gentoo Linux, stable,10,22,"Portage is a truly beautiful package manager and Gentoo is fun to maintain. As others have experienced, the first installation was a bit tough for me, but the instructions are terrific and complete. Using a default kernel adds to the compiling time, detracts from the customization, but it does help to get your first system up and running, and you can return after to refining a custom kernel. The IRC community is very friendly and helpful. The system that I got out of it was fast, although a lot of RAM gets used while compiling certain programs relative to my old laptop's capacity."
801,2022-09-21, Gentoo Linux, stable,1,2,"I attempted to install Gentoo in a kvm where I use various flavors of linux with absolutely no problems. After 5 days, countless hours and probably at least 5 reinstall attempts I was finally able to get past the grub menu which is where it hung on the first 3 attempts. I saw other people having the same issue and the best advice on the forums was to read the manual, LOL. The documentation is lacking and seems to leave you hanging in several places; do I do this?, do I do that?, where do we go from here? then having to configure USE & CPU flags that dont really give you any guidance either. I was able chroot back in to the failed installs and went back through all the settings, etc which were correct then ended up deleting them and starting over carefully reading through the docs again and finally grub came up and was expecting a nice new gnome desktop and nothing but a cli. I went through dmesg and it booted clean so I started searching for more info and found a gnome page and went through that and thinking startx might work but nope, no go. I'm guessing there may be some settings that need to be added for vm's but who knows. Not sure if this will install on bare metal better than a vm and I may try it sometime but I dont recommend wasting your time with it, there are way better distros out there that can be up and running in less than 20 minutes. This is at best a ""hobby"" distro that should be used as a learning tool and not much else. "

Update takes it time, but hey! this is Linux, you always can schedule an update, stop it and start it whenever you have time to do so.This is a rolling release distro, this means you don't have to reinstall everything because there is a new release nor lose your repo, I know this feature isn't very popular for server but for home PC users I feel it's lovely.You want to use wayland, you can, you want to use xorg also you can, same for gnome, kde, xfce, or even a ""deepin"" beautiful base frame, systemd or not, the choice is yours, be free to feel it, whatever you want your gentoo could be, I guess this powerful freedom it's hard to manage, and you have to be quite brave to embrace it.I want you to join us, be an spartan, be a gentoo user."
803,2022-09-05, Gentoo Linux, stable,10,20,"Gentoo fully embodies the opensource mindset: source is downloaded and compiled locally. The package manager (Portage/emerge) handles this smoothly: source files are downloaded from their respective repository, configured per your settings, and then compiled.True, the performance gains over precompiled binaries aren't what they were 10-15 years ago, but the capabilities that become available are worth it. In a theoretical sense, this opens up ultimate security and customization.Rebuilding my full install on 8 current-gen (2022) cores takes a good 5-6 hrs. That yields Openbox, Firefox, basic multimedia, and Steam games, among others. If you really want to break the mold, a few major apps are also offered in binary form (eg Libreoffice). Caution: it's not light on disk space (30+ gig for my root). I update monthly, which can take up to an hour, depending on packages. Portage lets you set a ""nice"" value for the compiler calls, which keeps the system usable for light work. Updating systems with default configurations is generally as easy as using pacman or apt.Though definitely not for beginners, documentation is generally well written and other outstanding doc efforts like Arch are applicable more often than not.What you end up with is a system that can inherently build most anything. Want to test out the latest GPU drivers from Mesa git with an obscure branch of wine/DXVK? The tools are ready to go. This is streamlined, customizable opensource at a fundamental level."

805,2022-08-18, Gentoo Linux, stable,10,65,"Gentoo is an incredible distribution: everything (well, almost...) comes in source and gets compiled on your own machine, with your own settings. Big packages like for example the kernel, Firefox, Chromium, etc. also come in binary form for convenience. There are currently 19,800 packages in the Gentoo repo and probably only a dozen or so are binary - wow.Installation can take a few hours, depending on the speed of your pc and whether you use a compiled kernel or not. Installation without reading the documentation is impossible. However, after reading the Gentoo Handbook carefully, installation is not that hard.The main difference with other Linux distributions is Portage - Gentoo's package management system. Most of your learning about Gentoo will probably be about Portage and its seemingly unbounded flexibility and countless features. Beside customization, another good thing about Gentoo is security: when updating the system the package manager tells you if your installation is affected by any of the vulnerabilities recorded in the Gentoo database (which gets updated regularly and promptly). I also like the Gentoo 'hardened' profile and its full support for SELinux (btw, Gentoo's documentation on SELinux is particularly clear and useful - probably one of the best that I've come across).To sum up: Gentoo comes with generally excellent documentation (some topicsare slightly outdated, although that is clearly stated). Expect to spend half a day reading the Gentoo Handbook *in full* and installing the system. After this, I think I needed another couple of days for properly 'digesting' the material. But now I have a much better understanding of how Gentoo works and have been able to customize it to my needs.Gentoo is an amazing system - congrats to its developers!"
806,2022-08-05, Gentoo Linux, stable,4,4,"The compile time is not worth the headache.  Unless you have some very specific needs with regards to software, the kernel, or drivers, then this distro would be a waste of your time.  There is a huge learning curve.  You have to learn how to compile packages, configure a kernel, and setup all the packages in your system.  You also will have to research and learn how to configure many of the config files on your system.  This literally takes weeks if not months of research and trial and error. There is no noticeable speed improvement when compiling packages vs. using binary packages, so it is not rewarding with regards to how much time it takes to setup and maintain.  If you are new to Linux, do not waste your time.  If you have specific needs, love to tinker, have thousands of hours to waste and love compiling software for hours, then this distro is perfect for you.  It is mainly ideal on severs that do not require a desktop GUI, such as a home file server. Most distros offer a minimal install option with no desktop that can install in under ten minutes, which is the faster option.  The community and development team at Gentoo is very small compared to other distros.  If you have a problem, expect to fix it yourself.  Also, I think the documentation is out of date so be prepared for many things not to work without further troubleshooting.  "
807,2022-08-04, Gentoo Linux, stable,9,9,"What I find most fascinating about Gentoo is the possibility for you to build a unique system, designed, executed and customized exactly how you want it how you need it. No unnecessary trinkets, no services and daemons running in the background and consuming precious resources.After a couple of years of trying, installing and reinstalling everything from scratch, I finally managed to put together a system that I consider to be perfect, that fully meets my needs, both on development and production platforms.So, for these considerations, I consider Gentoo a special system, unique, light years away from the hundreds of ""more of the same"" distributions offered on blogs, websites and specialized publications.Gentoo Linux is a rare and unconventional distribution."
808,2022-07-18, Gentoo Linux, stable,10,12,"I decided migrate to Gentoo from Fedora. I am truly amazed with Gentoo. I am using on my main machine, Lenovo notebook. 1400 packages and no compilations errors, it is impressive. I am using Steam, Libreoffice, Gnome Desktop, GIMP, Virt-manager, Flatpaks. Podman, Emacs, Firefox.My only issue was with Podman. I used custom kernel and Gentoo documentation is outdated, but I could manage instalation.It is better than Arch, of course it is my opinion. Gentoo is more stable, more cohese distro."
809,2022-07-17, Gentoo Linux, stable,1,0,"I think this distribution cannot be practically used on average because every time you try to install or upgrade it is going to be very slow. It is very ungreen program distribution technic. But it is not the worst. You should know how to configure Linux kernel exclusively to your machine. If you don't genkernel (the way to compile an universal kernel) is going to take several hours away on every update. Oh, I have just forgotten if you will try to update your system more then one time in day you are going to be banned for several days. It is crazy for source based distro. I had quited trying to install because precompiled kernel versions didn't run on my laptop and genkernel is not the way I can choose. Maybe if you have a very rare CPU architecture you will like Gentoo but many other distros have already been supporting ARM, for example, and I don't see any advantages in this solution. The FLAGs is the most crazy thing I have seen in all distribution I tried. If you haven't chosen functionality of your system during installation you cut off your abilities or new needs in programs you are going to install. "
810,2022-04-28, Gentoo Linux, stable,9,29,"Gentoo is unique: no other distro makes it so easy to make huge changes to how everything works, and then have those changes continue to be maintained and supported across time, so that heavily customised systems can still be kept up-to-date as upstream packages evolve. You basically give it a recipe for how you want your system built, and then it builds it that way from source, continually following your instructions if it's able to do so, as packages are updated...or prompting you if things have changed so much that you need to change your recipe. The outcome of all this is that you (a) have much more control over how you want your system to work, and so of course (b) you have to invest much more time in designing and maintaining it.As the project says itself, it's a ""meta-distro"": more like a set of tools for creating and maintaining your own distribution than a ""distribution"" in the normal sense (which involves particular selections of packages and configurations and so on). One person's Gentoo can look identical to an Ubuntu desktop, and have the same GNOME software and systemd and all the rest underneath it...another's can use a completely different init system and work with only the minimal software necessary to run a fast light window manager: it's like the kind of GUI customization that most Linux users do, only you do it with everything, from boot manager to desktop, even building your own custom kernels (the standard install procedure actually has you configuring your own kernel from scratch, choosing everything from the hardware and filesystems through to the timings and power management and so on). Obviously this is a nightmare for some people: for others it's a dream come true.I would never recommend Gentoo to non-technical users who are just wanting to surf the Internet and listen to music and write emails and so on: there's just no point in building your own unique system if you're happy with what's already available. On the other hand for real geeks and control freaks who enjoy fine-tuning everything to their exact specifications, it doesn't really get any better than Gentoo. Of course Arch does things more quickly and easily, Slackware does things more predictably and reliably, there are more opportunities to do things entirely your own way with LFS, and so on and so on...but in terms of hitting the sweet spot between power to change stuff (everything is built from source and can be configured and/or patched to work differently) and ease of maintaining all that change (e.g. you can type a single command and have hundreds of packages rebuilt, removing their support for features you don't want and building in new support for features you do), it's hard to beat Gentoo.I've given it 9/10 for what it is:it's a meta-distro, a framework for building your own distro however you like it, and enjoying official support for all that customisation. If it were trying to be an enterprise distro like Red Hat or a beginner-friendly distro like Ubuntu it would suck badly, of course...but Red Hat and Ubuntu already exist, so go use them if that's what you want: Gentoo is brilliant at what it's meant to be."
811,2022-04-23, Gentoo Linux, stable,9,17,"I've been using Gentoo since Corona gave me some more home office time.I used to use RedHat (with Enterprise support) mainly for servers and Ubuntu for desktop clients. At home I chose Arch Linux.Arch is really cool, but far too unstable for a serious working machine.Now I've found my desktop and (private) server distribution with Gentoo. Gentoo is rock solid, fast and delivers very up to date packages.In January of this year I switched most of our office workstations to Gentoo. With your own local bin-repo and distcc, updating at compile time is no longer a real problem.Unfortunately Gentoo didn't have corporate support, so most of our servers are running Redhat."
812,2022-04-23, Gentoo Linux, stable,1,1,"I used to use Gentoo years ago.  After years away, I decided to go back and give it a go.  The distro supposedly supports systemd.  However, the installation guide hasn't changed much in 15 years.  There are some references to systemd and a link to the systemd page, but the install instructions are seriously lacking.  The forums are sparse.  It takes hours to compile the base system, even on 8 cores with -j6 enabled.  The software is not bleeding edge unless you opt for testing in your make file.  Supposedly it is about choice. . . the choice not to know what to do next it seems.  If you like to tinker around in the system and compile software all the time, this is for you.  If you have a spare computer around it would be great.  Otherwise, I find that anything you learn in Gentoo you can also learn in other distros, i.e. compile and install a kernel.  At least someone who has done it before would be willing to document it in detail for you.I will work on it when I get a few hours of spare time seems to be there motto here.  This distro seems to be used by a core group of the same people who have been around for years and yet have no interest in making it less of a fishing expedition.  I got it up and running but there were lots of issues.  It is not straight forward by any means, even when following the handbook if you can even call it that.Pros: you can install a light base system with out a lot of bloat if you are interested in a command line system such as for a serverCons: too many to list, but primarily poorly documented outdated documentation, pitfalls and bugs galoreI would pass if I were you but if not don't say I didn't warn you."

If you are not in a complete hurry (like 5mins before your presentation starts) Gentoo is the only distribution that is worth spending time with. Portage is on another level compared to all the other package managers and use flags are a dream come true. You can control and build your system and it will be as lightweight or heavyweight as you want. Not as someone else promises. It takes a bit of commitment but the learning and understanding Linux experience is well worth it."

The system will calculate by itself what is required and will set all the package at the right version to keep consistency.I also like the fact that it's a rolling release distro.

815,2022-03-14, Gentoo Linux, stable,10,3,"The trick with source-based distros is to keep them lean!!!! That is why I do not have a full-blown desktop environment but instead use openbox as a standalone window manager with flatpaks and voila: it's a killer combo. I couldn't be happier ^_^. I do have Debian installed on my laptop as an alternative distro since it's the most stable binary based distro I've found and in a production environment, time is money. My heart truly belongs to Gentoo though. I highly recommend it to anyone who truly love Linux. You will not regret your choice."

817,2022-01-09, Gentoo Linux, unstable,10,26,"As stated before, Gentoo is probably not for everyone. Better say, it is for everyone, but not for every use case. If you expect distribution that will run out-of-the-box with minimum hassle, it might frustrate you, because it won't. Probably because there is no ""box"" in the first place.You are encouraged (and expected) to configure a lot of stuff yourself. Because, frankly there is no other way to run such flexible and customizable operating system. Also, speed benefits on modern day hardware are marginal compared to binary distributions. It does not mean that Gentoo isn't sleek and fast: it is. But I don't consider that a main advantage.What makes Gentoo stand out is what it allows you to do. It allows you to take control of every single tiny aspekt of your OS. To customize every package as you compile and install it, leaving unnecessary code (and bugs) out. It allows you to learn a lot in the process and Gentoo community is very knowledgeable about what they do and maintain. So your questions will be answered in very detailed fashion.It is an hobbist distro, but the work that developers do (in their free time) is astonishing. Gentoo have very professional and sophisticated community and if you put a little effort on your side you can benefit from it greatly.So if you are interested in learning how linux works and take more control into your own hands, this is definetely distribution for you. But you should be also prepared to invest some time to install and maintain it. Once you do, things will became much less demanding over time.ad. compiling time: Yes, compiling takes time, there is no way around it. But usually you can make use of distcc and offload the work to other computers in your network, speeding the things up considerably. Also saving your configuration files makes a lot of difference for any subsequent installations."
818,2021-12-31, Gentoo Linux, stable,10,2,"As an amateur of GNU/Linux, Gentoo has been a lodestone for me. Pre-configuring, compiling, and configuring every detail of a system is probably in-itself of marginal practical performance benefit for anybody who--like me--makes normal use of standard (in my case aging) hardware. Installing Gentoo takes time. It took me the better part of a week to get a fully stacked configured and customized system--three days to get a minimally functioning system with a custom kernel that were filled with reading and failure. If not for some downtime during the holidays during which I could devote myself to a little project, I would never have attempted it. When finally got a functioning system up and running with a custom kernel, fine-grained package control, and custom-compiled programs, the result was very satisfyingly slick!Compiling can take hours, but this is somewhat of a chimera used to scare people away from Gentoo, and an excuse by those who failed. Windows managers like i3 and dwm don't take very long to compile. Once you have the basics of the system in place, you can easily compile away on the bigger programs out of sight and mind in another tty or workspace.Portage is a marvel! It calculates dependencies making use of your own global, and customized package-specific flags, and then suggests configuration modifications your you to proceed with downloading, compiling and installing the source code. Installation is more detailed and takes far more manual intervention than with binary distributions--whether you consider this to be a positive or a negative is a good litmus test for whether Gentoo is the right tool for you. You can be confident that you will not be left alone in dependency hell, but you will need to manage dependencies with portage's help.I installed my system in 2021 on an Thinkpad T440s with Intel I5-4200U-Haswell processor (2013 release), 140G SSD, 8G RAM (from which I allocate a ZRAM tempfs for compiling)."

823,2021-11-14, Gentoo Linux, stable,10,14,"The package manager and KISS principle install process is the sole reason why I gave this distro a 10/10 rating. I started using Gentoo around a year or two ago and I'm not looking back. The installation isn't hard for no reason. It's hard because it has to be: to provide maximum customization to users - which is one of Gentoo's core ideas - you have to provide as much of it during install as possible. You can have an optimized install, an install with exotic hardware such as touchscreens working, a beautiful install, etc. running. But unlike some other KISS distros such as Arch, Gentoo provides a source-based package manager (Portage) with a customization method called USE flags, which can be set globally or to just one package. USE flags let specific parts of one or multiple programs to be added or taken out. Along with the highly customizable do-it-yourself install process, these flags provide maximum customization. It is also fairly easy to get packages into the main tree, and even easier to get them into community ""overlays,"" which are configuration files adding a git or rsync repo which Portage can get packages from. Finally, the packages which take a long time to compile sometimes have binary packages if you're willing to give up customization for quicker installation times. The one small gripe of mine is that some large packages, such as webkit-gtk, don't have a binary version to speed up installation if I don't want to customize that specific package."

And, you can follow instrucions inside Ubuntu.2. kernel tips. Go for dist-kernel first. Everything is working? Move to compile your kernel with genkernel. Everything still works? Try set up and compile manually, for last step.3. Dont install X. Check if you system is up. After, change to KDE or Gnome profile and install X.4. Grab firefox-bin. It is pre-compiled Firefox, it saves a lot of time.5. Install more specific drivers for your hardware, recompile your kernel removing unnecessary modules.You need patient and perseverance. At the end of process, you can enjoy your KDE (in my case) running with 700Mb of RAM or DWM with 200Mb of RAM. It is really great for humble hardwares."
827,2021-08-01, Gentoo Linux, stable,10,9,"Some reviews here state that Gentoo is not a beginner's distro, and that is absolutely correct. Don't use it if you want a working system out of the box, quick installs of new packages, and do not like to understand how a Linux system actually works. Also, if you do not like using the command line, then this distro is not for you. However, if you have a good understanding of Linux / Unix concepts, do not mind a bit of work, and if you are picky with respect to the software packages you enjoy using or how your system is set up, then this is the best distro out there. Mix and match to your heart's content.The default installation is quite bare, with no software bloat installed. You can choose to either deploy a complete a desktop environment (GNOME, KDE, XFCE, MATE, LXQT, and many more), or just install only the packages you want, tailored to your specific needs. The options to tailor your machine are endless: no two Gentoo systems are identical. Yet, with Gentoo's dependency based package manager, you always end up with a consistent system. You can even choose your filesystem (EXT4, BTRFS, JFS, etc), or init system (OpenRC, systemd, S6). Gentoo is very good at getting the best performance out of your hardware by utilizing the specialized instruction set of your CPU for the kernel and for compiled software. This includes also CPU instructions for encryption and decryption, which can speed up internet browsing (https, imaps), and disk encryption (luks). Most distros install precompiled versions of the kernel and of software packages and cannot take full advantage of the capabilities of your system, but Gentoo can.Lastly, Gentoo users and developers form a great community, with helpful people on irc, and a second to none wiki.If this all appeals to you then you should definitely have a go at Gentoo Linux."
828,2021-06-25, Gentoo Linux, stable,6,3,"I installed it, and it worked, I was not too fond of it, and I installed something that was not counting on me not having anything to do for a month while I compile my clock, browser, and everything else. I use Gnome, and that makes the installation take twice as long. The install guide is good, but it does not tell you that it takes days to complete if you are not running a thread-ripper AMD with 64 cores. With this Linux distribution, you will never have to worry about viruses. Your computer will not get one, and neither will you because your social life is over. You wanted to install something (you poor fool). By the time you have this installed, you will forget that it is a day ending in Y. If you have a two or four-core CPU and two GB per thread, you will not know what daylight is, and take a shower when you are done (you will need it).During the installation process, you will see things flash across your screen that you were never meant to see, and it will look like the Matrix broke in half as it compiles everything as the day ticks by. I am pretty sure that I saw the missing transcripts from the Nixon tapes and the names of the Roswell aliens in there. Strange stuffIf you like it, go for it, but it is not for me."
829,2021-06-06, Gentoo Linux, unstable,8,9,"Pros:- incredibly customizable- clean- portage has some cool featuresCons:- frequent dependency and use-flag conflicts which you have to manually resolve- package availability, there's really not a lot of them even in the overlays- compilation times- you need to have a brain to use it (turns out I don't have one)"
830,2021-05-26, Gentoo Linux, stable,10,0,"The best for configurability, let's you create a customized distro you are happy with.  Amazing set of available packages and extending with custom software much easier than with a rpm or deb based distribution.The downside is that it is more time consuming to manage, don't use if you are pressed for time or just don't want to deal with it.  I probably spend an hour on average every week managing my home network."
831,2021-05-15, Gentoo Linux, stable,10,1,Its great. It stopped me from distrohopping every month. You can set custom use flags for compiling (its a source based distro). Its fast and small. Try it if you havnt!
832,2021-05-10, Gentoo Linux, unstable,10,1,"An (experienced) tinkerer's dream. Use flags are great, kernel customization is great, and the overall customization is great."
833,2021-04-24, Gentoo Linux, stable,10,0,"Not for beginners.  But after using Mandrake and Fedora, I learnt sooo much when I first installed Gentoo in 2007!  Before Gentoo, I would run away with my tail between my legs when something I wanted required recompilation of my Linux kernel mumbling that I wasn't thát desparate.  Since that first install (which took a day and a night; the night to compile KDE) it seems like a piece of cake.  Before Gentoo, I knew how to use a Linux system, since Gentoo I know how to USE a Linux system: how to partition and format discs, configure and compile a kernel, optimise code for my processor, create system services, etc.  Since Gentoo, I feel I can tackle any Linux issue.  I'm spoiled now by the amount of choice; I can configure nearly everything.  Software is compiled from source and optimised for my CPU.  So-called USE flags enable me to switch off or on different parts of each software package: no Bluetooth support if my system doesn't have Bluetooth, no Gnome support when I run KDE/Plasma and no GUI at all on a headless machine.  Gentoo currently offers 10 different versions of the gcc compiler, is available for 14 different architectures (many more than just x86(_64) and arm) and comes with 14 USE flags for detailed configuration.  Hence, a whopping 150 billion different versions of gcc can be installed when using Gentoo (albeit only 10.7 billion on any given system).  Of course I'll never try them all, but imagine how often I can change my mind before I run out of options!The drawback is compilation time: installing a typical package takes minutes, not seconds.  As a solution, my system updates itself when my laptop is awake during the (usually Friday) night.  If the process is still ongoing in the morning, I can kill it, so that I can use my laptop normally during the day, and resume it in the evening.  For me, the compilation times are worth it, but I'm sure this is not true for all."
834,2021-04-11, Gentoo Linux, stable,10,0,I've been using Gentoo Linux as a desktop and server system for over 12 years. I love the flexibility and diversity of the operating system.The documentation is very detailed and easy to understand.I've got used to the compilation time. The control of the package installations via USE flags is a privilege that I do not want to do without.Keep it up :)
835,2021-04-09, Gentoo Linux, unstable,7,0,"Every next day ...... more masked packages,... more outdated packages,... more missing packages.For many packages you have to look in the overlay or try to install from source by configuring your ebuild with git preferably.If you send source code to try to be approved, get ready for the impossible mission."
836,2021-04-04, Gentoo Linux, stable,8,0,"Gentoo linux is highly configurable OS, but beware: there is no install wizard!  It is a minimal OS, you only install the features and packages YOU need. Desktop users should expect to spend some time configuring and compiling everything. At least the documentation is good (compared to ""just works"" OS's like Fedora or Ubuntu).It's package management is source based, but there is support for binary packages as well. Large packages like firefox or libreoffice can be installed via binary. If you have a fleet of computers, you can compile once and distribute your binaries easily. You can also use distcc to compile across multiple computers.Gentoo also has a number of nice features including:USE flags - makes it easy to manage package features and optional dependenciesCrossdev - bootstraps compilers (for example mingw or arm64)Genkernel - configures and compiles your kernel/initramfsOpenRC - alternative Init system to systemd, easy to make init scriptsElogind - alternative to systemd's logindGentoo Linux has an interesting vision for what an OS should be. It's not perfect, but it may be the best OS for experienced linux users."

Also the default tweaks to gnome feel very usable and the desktop feels cohesive and exceptionally well thought out.No surprise though since the creater of the nobara project is the one and only Glorious Eggroll.Overall an excellent distro and one I can see myself happy with in the long term."

After the installation, a detailed welcome screen leads through the numerous further setting options, understandable and clear for everyone. Various desktop layouts are offered, quite a few useful Gnome extensions are already on board. Further setup is a breeze, especially for gamers.

Somehow it has the best installer dialogue I have ever used (Calamares is incredible and GE did a great job using it for Nobara) and the first time set up was clear, sensible, and with only a couple minor redundancies in the process. After all that, it's just good ol' KDE on Fedora, but with great defaults and preconfigured packages for gaming.

The boot process made it to a, beautifully looking, KDE desktop and immedeately launched the gui -installer, without further intervention from me. I managed to open a terminal and `sudo -su`. Next, in addition to the system allocated zram swapspace, I added some more 16 GB, already existing on my HD. Thereafter I ran `top -S`, watching memory and swap space -usage going up straight away, consuming every available byte of real and swap memory. The process in charge was jfs-debug. Yes, I do have two jfs -partitions on my hd, but what makes the installer sniff around my data before I give it the parameters which partition(s) to use? I kept watching the installer gui ""loading module 1"" and the `top` CPU & memory usage until the system came to a halt: no more mouse pointer visible, no reaction on Alt+Tab. No chance to enter `systemctl -i reboot`on the console.At last I had to press the hardware reboot button and felt relieved after stating that none of my partition data had been corrupted.

Not once have I had to spend hours to repair update damage to get my hardware running again. Even  Nobara Installation USB can serve as sort of a rescue disk. It comes with a well written user manual with great installation instructions.In five months, I've never had a problem excepting one that I caused.

The GNOME environment is smooth, although I prefer KDE I preferred to install the distribution's default environment. Wayland display server behaves well but some applications, go crazy. At the moment Blender 3.x is likely that using HIP may crash your application and give you a sudden shutdown. Applications that make use of Tensorflow, Python, Keras, Conda: Deep Learning applications (Stable Diffusion has several difficulties).

It's a highly customized ""spin"" of the base distribution with ready access to drivers and tweaks that can significantly improve system performance--especially for gaming. You might have heard of the distro's maintainer, Glorious Eggroll, who also works for Red Hat and develops a custom fork of Steam Proton, the compatbility layer for playing Steam games for Windows on Linux.With Fedora 37's removal of mesa packages for decoding videos with AMD GPUs (due to patent issues), it became more apparent just how much the average user needs to customize Fedora after install just to get a decently working computer. Nobara automates this process and does a lot of advanced tweaks that most users would never have sought themselves. It can come across as a highly customized experience but if you've used GNOME or KDE before you really aren't going to be in too unfamiliar a territory.If you didn't care for Fedora, this distro won't change your mind about it, but if you want to push Fedora's capabilities beyond its official vanilla release and save at lot of time in setup, give this one a try."

I liked Fuguita when I tried it a year ago. It's very light on resources, it's stable and live boots a pure version of OpenBSD.I give it a 10/10 for that. But from what I could tell, they claim that it's easy to remaster iso's and install software, but I could never find any documentation for it and could never figure out how to do it.It's cool in that it boots like a basic DOS, I love that it's live and can be run entirely on CD, but what exactly can I do with it but stare at the desktop? I can't get online with it since there is no browser installed.So, I'm not sure how useful it is to me as an operating system (I can do far more with a Freedos bootable CD, cause I actually have programs for it to run on), but nonetheless, I do ""like"" it and I do appreciate the effort put into it."

There is also a very good setup guide on their website.I am looking forward to a steep relearning curve, on a 'proper' UNIX-type system.Overall, I also recommend FuguIta."

Not sure why we need another Mint with Snaps added? Couldn't we have just installed Snaps in Mint if we really wanted Snaps? Its nice to see Canonical give its blessing and support to this distro. But honestly, do we really need another distro which basically doesn't change much beyond what is already out there. I found it to run fine on my Mini PC but then again so does every OS I have tried on it. I just don't find anything compelling in Ubuntu Cinnamon to move the needle in better then any other distro already out there. "
883,2023-07-21, Ubuntu Cinnamon, 23.04,9,4,"I think it has improved a lot compared to the LTS 22 version. Now there are not so many bugs. It feels clean and comfortable, and frankly, Ubuntu is still the best Linux distro to ""install and work the next minute."" Yes, Debian exists, but you have to add a thousand things that end up making it exhausting: adding users to the sudoers list, non-free repositories, installing flatpaks, etc. On Ubuntu Cinnamon snaps work pretty fast.Cinnamon is still the right choice for me. I have installed Linux Mint many times because I love Cinnamon, but I must admit that Ubuntu Cinnamon comes with a new kernel and gnome 44. All of this is very noticeable on new hardware like mine.It has a very nice brown theme, at least to me.Great job."
884,2023-07-02, Ubuntu Cinnamon, 23.04,9,12,"It has been asked a few times ""why Ubuntu Cinnamon rather than Linux Mint?"". There are some good reasons.First, it is based on GNOME 44 rather than 40, which has real improvements even if GNOME Desktop is swapped out as here.Second, there is a smaller and more even set of apps; the XApps are not used. gedit, gthumb, evince and celluloid provide basic file support. GIMP is also installed by default.Third, the authors have done great work in theming Ubuntu Cinnamon so that it offers analogues of the excellent vanilla Ubuntu themes, including icons. ""Yaru-prussiangreen-dark"", for example, is an option.A thoughtful feature is that Ubuntu Cinnamon uses GNOME Software, not Ubuntu's fork. That means that flatpaks, snaps and .debs are all viewable and updatable from the same application; there is not the nonsense of having two almost identical software managers after you add flatpak support to vanilla Ubuntu.The only issues are minor; there are a few slips (the login screen says ""22.04"" when it is not; some of the 4K wallpapers are pixelated; celluloid is a very old version). Vanilla Ubuntu blows hot and cold on keeping up with minor versions anyway, but I would like to see Cinnamon brought up to the latest minor version here: Ubuntu Cinnamon offers Cinnamon 5.6.7 and nemo 5.6.3, whereas the latest versions are 5.6.8 and 5.6.4. Similarly with GNOME Software (44.2 rather than 44.0) as, from the changelogs, there are real improvements.Ubuntu Cinnamon, somewhat to my surprise, is impressive. I dislike GNOME Desktop and the Mint ""old software, even older kernel"" jibe does resonate here, so Ubuntu Cinnamon was worth a try. It is now my daily driver. "

I really do not notice much in the way of real separation from what Linux Mint team is offering. I guess this is of no surprise given Linux Mint is basically Ubuntu with Cinnamon desktop environment much like Ubuntu Cinnamon. Not a big technical person here, but I suppose you could assume Ubuntu Cinnamon is slightly more inline with Ubuntu as a whole now that it is a official release. Sort of like so many browsers use Chromium but are not exactly Google Chrome just sort of Chrome-ish. I find Ubuntu Cinnamon a worthy option and don't mind the fact it lacks fractional scaling which really isn't very good yet, and Snap inclusion doesn't bother me given I don't see it going away.Personally, I still believe Gnome is Linux future on the desktop along with Wayland.

Been using SME-SERVER for years and have never had any issues that could not be fixed by searching the server’s contribs pages and/or forums for answers etc. The system is template based so you can change almost all system configurations without having to alter the original file. For example if you want to change the php.ini you can copy the original template to a customs template directory and fine tune your settings without actually modifying the original /etc/php.ini file. However, most settings are already included in the various databases that you can configure with simple commands like [db configuration mysqld LocalNetworkingOnly yes] and these are all well documented on the server’s koozali.org wiki pages. Off the shelf, the server is configured with a DHCP server, Mail server, File Server, DNS server, Web Server, Database Server (mysql/maria). All are set and configured in roughly 30 minutes and I’ve never had a box give me problems upon installation. Two things I would improve on is the upgrade transition that the last one v10.x required that you reinstall instead of upgrade and that the system is centos based but is always lagging a couple versions."

I refuse to waste my time even enumerating them here. This server distro is a just a huge steaming pile. In my life, I've come to learn that when faced with a mystery as to why something is the way it is, looking at the ""money"" angle will almost always provide the answer. The ""Donate"" button in the web portal works just fine, although some other links/buttons don't. And their obnoxious ""Remember that SME Server is free to download and use, but it is *not* free to build"". I would suggest that if it's such a costly burden to build, stop building it and pick some other distro to donate your spare developing time to. "

Preface, if you want a distribution all special effects and configuration wizards, stay away from it, it is not for you.If, on the other hand, you are looking for substance, read on.Slackware is ""old school"" linux but that does not mean it is obsolete or unsuitable for use in a modern PC or server, simply that it follows the KISS (keep it simple stupid) philosophy and does not decide instead of the end user how it should be used. It provides a choice of software, DE, and WM that may be redundant for many but all of which allows for much, if not all, of what is needed to begin using it. For everything else there is slackbuilds.org and various repositories of already compiled packages, as an example I can mention AlienBOB aka Eric Hameleers.Slackware does not dazzle with customization and special effects aimed at catching new users, everything is in ""vanilla"" configuration, that is, as released by the software developers, including the kernel but if you have the patience to learn about the distribution and do not let yourself be discouraged by the fact that any configuration will have to be done by editing the configuration files, either through the system tools or manually, you will end up with a system that is truly your own and not one prepared according to someone else's tastes.At first it seems hostile, but in the long run the satisfaction of learning how it works might even convince you to stop jumping from one distro to another."

With Slackware it's possible to have a functional operating system that takes up disk sizes reminiscent of days gone by. With Slackware you learn to be a conscious user , to move your brain, to understand what well-made software looks like. Slackware is especially useful for servers. For those who want a DAW or graphics workstation : better to lean on Devuaan , which can draw on a large software pool. If you take pleasure in drugging yourself with special effects at the click of a button, Slackware is not for you."

911,2023-03-23, Slackware Linux, 15.0,9,16,"When Slackware came out, the web, and the distro concept, were new ideas. By the time I started to use it, Slackware was one of the old established brands in a field populated with fly-by-nights.  I thought, when moving from an established, proprietary, OS  to something comparatively new and experimental I would be leaping in the dark and due a beard singe and finger burn. When I realised that I would be running the installer only once every few months, to a year, its quotidian appearance was less worrying than  it could be. It is not true that Slackware comes with everything but the kitchen sink. I comes with a range of kitchen sinks. There are several desktops, several free-standing window managers, several of just about every kind of internet server you could possibly want, a surprisingly complete gcc package set, format converters and codecs, programmes I have found as binaries nowhere else. That is just on the standard installation iso that fits onto a 4GB usb stick. Once you get used to the installation and format convertion tools, installing openoffice and Libre Office on the same system is easy and simple to do. You may even like to install one of a number of third-party for-Slackware semi-graphical installers. These typically do dependancies, and not just that, they compile from verified source, automatically. However, you do have to  install them first, by hand, with web browser and installation tookit.There are other products missing from Slackware that you may expect, such as gnome. You can get cinnamon and possably some other respins of gnome from some of the main third-party sites that, for me at least, take Slackware to the next level.What advice do I have for new users ? Install sbotools and sboui, if you must have dependancy resolution. Do not be alergic to the command line. And finally, if in doubt ask."
912,2023-03-10, Slackware Linux, 15.0,9,19,"Slackware is a classic. There is little I can say about it that hasn't already been said. It has a well-deserved reputation for being stable and conservative. It adheres more closely to the traditional UNIX philosophy of keeping things simple and using text files for system configuration.I do think it would be better if dependency checking were added to the main package tools. This would eliminate the need to ""install everything or you will have problems later."" Then Slackers could more easily build leaner, more customized installations like you can do with distros like Arch, or Void, or Gentoo. For those who remain convinced that dependency checking is a bad or unnecessary thing, there could be an option to disable it (--no-dep-check or similar).But I guess if this has not been done in the past 30 years, the chances are probably low.In any case, I still have a lot of respect for Slackware."

I think it was version 3.5 ;) Time goes by and I had forgotten about Slackware for years. Because of the release of the 15th, I decided to play with it. Finally I've got everything set up the way I wanted. It's OK.So where is my bitter disappointment?As the oldest Linux on the market, it should have very good documentation. There was plenty of time to do that. And what do I see?The Slackware documentation is not only bad. It is downright sloppy! It makes me cry when I look at it.No, I don't buy ""don't be lazy, there's everything you need on the web"" answers. This is not the way modern projects are developed. This creates confusion and discourages new users.I will not criticize the official website of the project. Though I could. However, where is a good Handbook? It does not exist. ""The Slackware Book Project"" looks like it was written on a lap by a freshman. The ""beta"" of new version is been being created. Information on the web is scattered on various websites often outdated and sometimes even harm instead of helping. And don't tell me it isn't. Do You really want to talk about various system update instructions which can be find on web?Kind of KISS philosophy, but not quite. Rather,the view is pushed that it is a ""system for advanced users"" but in practice: ""puzzle system - solve it yourself"". In addition, the not-so-nice community that get irritated when someone asks too trivial questions and refers to MAN pages, instead of writting a complete guide once and for all.Slackware is a good piece of software and could be a very friendly distro but it is not. Patrick focused on the code itself and forgot about the rest part of the project. The community that should have fought for new users also overslept. This was not done and at the moment Slackware is a niche distribution despite it's potential. Strong competition in the operating system market made Slackware a system for hobbyists and a small group of enthusiasts."
916,2022-10-12, Slackware Linux, 15.0,10,71,"If you want something really modern-looking and flashy then this isn't it, but it's stable, sane and dependable.Not for beginners, unless you are looking to put some work in and learn something.

Quite a lot of software is available as binaries and the ports library is huge, so I've not had a problem getting the programs I need. Especially good if you have some old kit you want to keep going; I'm carrying around a 2006 32-bit ThinkPad running Slackware 15.0 and it runs beautifully, in 2022!"

In other's negative reviews I often notice complaints that have simple solutions if your familiar with Slackware. This could definitely be averted by better documentation on Slackware's end. Slackware definitely is at a disadvantage attracting new users with its steeper learning curve but, to say that no one is picking it as a distro for the first time is inaccurate.Philipfirst time Slackware user of 1 year. "
918,2022-08-29, Slackware Linux, 15.0,10,108,"It's a fantastic distribution. Because the design decisions are made by a single person, the entire OS feels like a complete package, which resembles *BSDs. The same person is doing it for 30 years, so you know exactly what guiding philosophy to expect, and every release will be as easy to navigate as the previous ones. For those of us who like a well working computer that does not send you in re-learning mode every release.The packaging system is very simple, and consists of a managed compressed tarballs with optional scripts to ease installations. There is no artificial dependency checks, yet some tools like slapt-get, which mimic Debian's apt-get, offer that. The system comes in complete, with a wealth of libraries and software for any occasion, and scripts used for the default packages are available. Those scripts might come in handy since Slackware has a philosophy of not including any patches unless absolutely necessary. Running software as design by the creators makes the system predictable and very stable. During installation it offers to exclude individual software, or entire categories, such as the entire KDE environment at once. Additionally multiple repositories run by volunteers or Slackware-compatible spinoff distributions exist. However, there is also the collection of scripts called SlackBuilds, optionally managed by such programs as sbopkg, which are able to compile or properly package binaries for most things that is ever needed, much like ports in *BSD world, but not as complex as Gentoo's Portage, and more transparent than Arch Linux's AUR. They are tested for consistency, standardized, and well maintained. For those very rare occasion where an obscure program is not available, the simplicity of packages themselves and wealth of libraries already included in Slackware make creating new packages a very simple and elegant experience comparing to .deb or .rpm.Slackware for now does not come with SystemD, but has it's own *BSD-like init scripts, as well as SystemV compatibility, so the traditional Linux scripts will run fine by default. However, the simplicity of the system allow for installation of SystemD with easy if one really wants it. In fact, the ease of modifying the system is one of its greatest strengths. All configurations files are well commented, each program is unmodified from upstream so their documentation will be always accurate, and the transparency of the system makes it very easy to visualize how any given change fits in the operating of the system. While the default Slackware works great, putting in a little bit of learning on how to make it work just for the user is immensely rewarding, and the conservative philosophy makes the modifications long lasting. No more reconfiguring everything every release!"

Actually Pat needs to fold Salix (or whats left of Salix) into Slacware (my opinion). What Salix has is Stapt-get/Gslapt. Although Slapt-get/Gslapt is available for Slackware 15.0, I found the developer didn't quite get the update right to run correctly. BUT Salix repositories (yes there are still Salix repositories -- and there are even Slackware 15.0 Salix repositories) The Sailix versions of Slapt-get/Gslapt were superior to the developer's version. Of course the lion's share of packages to complete my Slackware 15.0 came from Slackbuilds.org, because that's where you KNOW, you build the source code so it SHOULD work with Slackware 15.0. Alas, When Slackware 15.0 debuted, Slackbuilds was not ready for Slackware 15.0... not right away... I had to give it like 2-3 weeks. But they work okay now. Albeit a lot of the packages need to be updated to newer versions. If Pat could fold Slapt-get/ Gslapt into Slackware, and use the packages from Slackbuilds, WE would really have a most modern up-to-date Linux Distro (my opinion).My system is pretty good now. But I had been without my Slackware PC's for some time, and had forgotten a lot of Linux in that time. So I had to relearn Old School Linux with the new Slackware 15.0. Which I did.  I run the Window Manager Openbox on my Slackware systems. It makes the old hardware of this laptop more perky.With that I run Feh, Tint2 (with Jgmenu), and i pipe a full Openbox menu to the Standard Right-click Openbox menu with obmenu-generator.So I have 2 ""start menus"". I'm weird. All in all, I would not trade my Slackware 15.0 for all the Ubuntu's in the world. Rock Solid? YEP. It sure is. Was it rough getting here? Meh... I actually tried Xubuntu  for a few weeks while Slackbuilds was getting itself up to Quality. Hated it. Went right back to Slackware 15.0. That should tell you a lot.

I used different other Linux distros from time to time like Ubuntu, SUSE, Fedora, Debian, Arch etc. but Slackware is unique. It is stable and with this new version 15 is suitable for a new or old computers. Yes as I said I have tried Arch too and is really great but Slackware is better, but this is my own opinion. What I really like from Slackware is that you are the boss of your PC and you update things when you decide to do it, not the other way around like the most ""easy"" distros. With Slackware you have a full control and when something goes wrong you know what to do to roll it back, the other ""easy"" distros that do everything automatically behind the scenes if something breaks you don't know what went wrong. So for me easy distro is Slackware because I am doing everything by myself and at the same time I'm learning how to use Linux. And yes, I can sleep at nights, and I'm not praying after of each update or upgrade if something goes wrong. I know my PC will start only a hardware failure will stop me.

In my experience it seems to be good for servers, but not practical for daily desktops if you don't fit into one of the categories mentioned above. Despite this, I decided to try the latest release, version 15, and I had some video problems on my laptop with an Atom processor, such as programs stuttering when opening, or glitches in the rendering of windows when moving, leaving some artifacts on the screen during the process, probably related to drivers (?), and also some connection problems, that at certain times I was disconnected and reconnected.

In short, this distribution works with the most modern computers, but can give life to real dinosaurs.After the first start of the system, some things should be changed to speed up the boot time, but everything is solved by setting a few parameters.Slackware is anything but abandoned, but it is followed by many competent people scattered in the most famous forums.In the end, knowing how to overcome the few difficulties you will have an exceptional system that has seen many competitors born and die …… .. there will be a reason !!!!!!!"

If you're new to Linux there's a learning curve but it's not steep if you understand Unix commands, even from MacOS.There are plenty of tools for package and dependency management - just not in the base install so you chose how to do that. It's not hard.You'll either love it or hate it but, much like vi is the one true editor, Slackware is the one true Linux.Would you rather live with unanswered questions or would you rather live with unquestioned answers?"

Rather than upgrade my existing 14.2 install, I opted for a clean install on a Distec ESI604DC industrial PC. I setup a local source on my webserver, and installed via a PXE boot. I had a play with Plasma, but really didn't like it. XFCE4 is more to my taste, but I have always liked the simplicity of fluxbox, and soon had it customised just how I like it. I usually leave out KDE, as I find it just takes up space, though I do have the prettier TDE installed on my 14.2 box.I find Slackware the least annoying operating system. It has few faults, it doesn't get in the way of what I want to do, and is very well supported by a usually friendly community. I really don't need anything other than lilo as a boot manager, as I understand it well, and it works very reliably. If I wanted to use grub instead, it would be simple to change to it. My PC is fast and responsive, despite having only 4GB RAM and a 60GB hard disc. Web browsing is faster than my wife's W10 machine, and full screen video smooth, using VLC (easy to install from AlienBob's repo.) I want a system which isn't hidden away, which allows, and encourages understanding. The popular Debian based distros attract many answers on the forums, but much like windows advice, the quality of answers is patchy, and can lead down the wrong paths. Slackware answers tend to be from people who know what they are doing.Shout out to Eric Hamerleers, Patrick Volkerding, and all the other hard working enthusiasts who keep this project current and secure.

As usal performance is good, inline with other fast distros.I do a mix of desktop and server usage, on the former relying on KDE.Installation is as you would expect of good old slackware and everything is working.But beware that some post-install configurations are mandatory such as fine tuning for SSD optimization, enabling basic services, and installing software you use and are not already included in the base distro.Of these I would highlight:- Libreoffice- VLC- Inkspace- google-chromeThese can be easily obtained trusted third party repos (from trusted people I, mean). Checkout Alienbob's repo for instance.(This is one thing I really like about slackware: it has a ""personal"" feeling i.e you know can name some of the ppl behind the scenes.)If you have a little patience slackbuilds.org will be updated to support version 15, and then you'll have access to even more software which you can build yourself.I like to use slackpkgplus and sbopkg to automate things a bit, but these are in no way mandatory.If you have difficulties search linuxquestions, but before read the documentation!

With support for modern accelerated graphics for Intel and AMD out of the box, the desktop experiance is smooth. The addition of ffmpeg and SDL2 out of the box is welcome as well. For those that want the ability to do enterprise style authentication, the adoptoin of PAM is welcome, and for those that don't need it, the default of shadow passwords means that you can continue as before.The two most obvious omissions are libreoffice and vlc, both of which are available from alien's repository. If you don't know where these are, for example a quick google of slackware alien vlc will find them.for slackware familiars, this is a welcome update that preserves investment in learning, but manages to include the current stuff like python3 and kde plasma as well.If you are new to slackware, give it a go. It is a different experiance from the hand-holding you get with ubuntu, for example, but if you want control over your os and are prepared for a bit of learning, It is well worth a go. You may hear about lack of depedency handling, but don't let that alarm you. There is so much included in the full install that you have most of what is needed out of the box.

An intermezzo with Alien Bob's slackware current, almost two years ago, ended abruptly, after the introduction of PAM through slackpkg locked me out from my system. So I was curious about 15.0, grabbed it instantaneously when I saw the news here @Distrowatch.I installed the (erronously, instead of 64-Bit) downloaded, 32-Bit ISO into a vacant partition and was fine with the  good ol' ncurses based routine. At large I come to the same conclusions as the 15.0 Feature Story by Jesse Smith, with a few additional remarks:* installation with selection of jfs -filesystem hang; start again from scratch with ext4 -destination was okay* as in the last 15 years lilo install to a partition fails. No problem for me to include Slackware into another lilo or grub -config on the same machine* the packaged falkon -browser does not work for me* Alien Bob's Chromium package for 'current' also crashes* base system is fast* the KDE -desktop layout looks beautiful and modern* for me the Caligra office suite is just fine.Subjectively I conclude that Slackware is an awesome peace of work, but obviously I have outgrown the approach: the days when I took pride in compiling kernel etc. myself, finding solutions for OS hardships are gone. Perhaps one day Slackel, Zenwalk or a born-again Salix, even Vector Linux may help over the undue amount of packages installed by the official Slackware, but I'm not sure if / when I'll take a chance ..."

But we are talking about a distro more suited for business and more advanced users. I was not expecting myself to see a Ubuntu or Mint type simple install. Personally I like the pure Gnome look and it performs really well even on my quad Celeron Mini PC. I never felt like it was slow and it even felt a little more responsive then Windows 10 or 11. I probably won't stick with Fedora very long as I find it a little more business oriented then consumer. One interesting note I found it interesting that Fedora foud all the hardware properly and Windows could not and required several drivers to be manually installed. Apparently Geekom the maker of this mini does not register drivers with Microsoft for updating through Windows. This is one area I always took points off for Linux and its drivers. But I think at least in this case it worked very well. "
959,2023-07-12, Fedora, 38,8,5,"The main issue I find with linux distros is their issues with new hardware which makes finding the right distro difficult and fedora is no different. Obviously it makes sense in this predicament to install a distro with the most up to date kernels available which limits the distro selection as most distros are still using 5.x.I chose fedora 38 after trying tumblewwed and some older distros. Tumbleweed  resulted kernel panics on boot while a reboot alleviated it which was weird but I did like the speed and memory usage.I have a ryzen 5 and radeon integrated graphics and that is an issue so I found because the first thing I found is that wayland does not play nice which is default in fedora and it causes system freezes. I use x11 which works perfectly.The second issue I found was with memory, it actually jumped to 4.2 GB which was weird considering suse was using 2.7 GB, I found this to do with kmail and dependant packages which I removed as I dont use an email client anyway which brought it down to 2.5 GB with browser working and 1.5 without.The finger sensors dont work because its too new which i dont care about anyway, it does not work on any distro.The third issue was speed which i loved in suse and I found that this was down to the default animation speed set in each distro. I set it to instant in fedora and it was faster than suse.Another issue I found was the issue with hd audio which is not using the main driver and when you turn it on the audio stops, again, new hardware has issues. This is a general linux problem though and causes stability issues with newer laptops.This distro is never for the newbie and never was.It does require tweaking to get it right and is essential for new hardware as my laptop is 4 months old.Older hardware should be fine with fedora."

From a new user perspective, it is a little difficult to understand everything. This is where Ubuntu is better in my opinion. Ubuntu's installation process in the recent 23.04 is very appealing, has a nice and polished UI and an easy way to install the system: just clicking next a bunch of times. For the new user this is optimal for the Operating System experience. Besides the installation process, another thing they don't do that Ubuntu does is having the ability to enable Multimedia codecs in the installer.

Despite numerous attempts to reinstall the software on various machines, the performance remained unsatisfactory. In my humble opinion, Fedora 37 performs much better. It seems that Fedora 38 lacks optimization, and exhibits qualities of a beta or alpha product. Additionally, I have also encountered issues with its boot process as the panels or top bar do not load correctly, rendering the software unusable. This is unfortunate and disappointing."
973,2023-05-04, Fedora, 38,2,5,"Despite Fedora's potential advantages, my assessment revealed several notable concerns.. Performance and Package Management:Fedora's DNF package manager, while operational, faces difficulties in matching the speed and effectiveness of its counterparts.Stability and Usability:My Fedora experience was negatively impacted by system instability, which significantly influenced my overall perception. Moreover, Fedora's Gnome desktop environment is resource-demanding and missing crucial features.Beginner Friendliness:The limited guidance Fedora offers for installing codecs, basic utility softwares etc results in a challenging learning curve for new users. The possibility of updates disrupting Gnome extensions is an additional source of problem.Compatibility and Support:Fedora encounters compatibility issues such as boot complications with specific graphics cards. Furthermore, software developers might not offer extensive support for this distribution. Problems with driver compatibility, WiFi connectivity, and faulty DNS resolution exacerbate the user experience.Software Center and Pre-installed Applications:While Fedora's software center boasts an appealing interface, it falls short in search functionality, compelling users to rely on command-line approaches. Pre-installed apps  suffer from missing codec problems and lag, necessitating extra post-install tasks to ensure the system is suitable."

976,2023-04-21, Fedora, 38,10,15,"All in all, a very pleasant experience so far. I have always used Ubuntu before, but since Canonical does not support Flatpak, I have decided to use Fedora. Despite the fairly recent software, Fedora is very stable. What I like most is the integration of Flathub out-of-the-box. Which means I don't need most of the other sources, like Chrome or Steam repositories. You can get all that from Flathub and it works without any problems.Gnome 44 is a great desktop environment and has been implemented very well. The dark mode is also great and you can easily enable dark mode for legacy applications thanks to Gnome tweaks. This is especially useful for some flatpaks. Very simple. The fonts are also very pleasant.What I do not like is the default file system BTRFS. The default partinioning is also incompatible with timeshift. Snapshots cannot be created with it. You have to specify @ and @home in the installer first, only then a snapshot with Timeshift works without problems. This could be improved. Apart from that, there is not much more to say. All in all, the first impression is great and a serious alternative to Ubuntu.Thanks a lot."

Haven't personally used any of the spins such as the immutable version, however the standard distribution is amazing. The repositories are really up to date and stable at the same time, the default environment is lean and uses modern technologies such as Wayland and Pipewire. The two reasons I can't give it a 10/10 even though it's my daily driver is:- The installer is absolutely awful as of 37. Apparently this will be changed in the next update- No Flathub by default, or no complete Flathub at all. Although this is minimized by the fact they mantain their own flatpak repositories.Overall I recommend the distribution, but you should be aware that you will need to tinker with it a bit to get a good experience, this is not the best distribution ""out-of-the-box"" but is instead a really good base for your Linux desktop."

Before I get into the issues, Fedora and some other distros are in a sweet spot of having corporate funding behind it, yet having a very good philosophy around free software yet it is less dogmatic than FSF endorsed distros. Everything works very well and the packages are also very up to date, especially compared to Debian based distros.The main issues with it is that DNF feels a little slow and the desktop revolves around GTK DEs, the latter is a matter of personal taste but the former may be a deal breaker for some. However, I have heard that Fedora 38 makes DNF speedier, along with a lot of other anticipated updates. If you aren't a Fedora user already I would wait until 38 comes out before switchingAll this being said, it is best for relatively newer computers, it needs nothing cutting edge but even XFCE uses ~800mb of ram. You may get away with LXQt and swap, but Qt feels like a second class citizen on Fedora.I realize this sounds like a negative review, but I really think it is one of the best distros available, everything works (especially if you are only looking to use Free software) especially with 38 on the horizon."

These are the ONLY distros that actually get out of your way and resemble an OS made by a professional organisation. Fedora, in particular, has a gorgeous, understated elegance; the only distro that's default install looks better than Windows and Apple. Other distros try to be different but just add unnecessary clutter and bling that is beyond obnoxious or try to be ""linuxy"" by making it an absolute to install and run."
992,2023-01-14, Fedora, 37,10,7,"What an absolute amazing distro! Has the great balance of being stable for performance but still having up to date with it's ""semi-rolling release"" structure. Security is well known as well with SELinux implemented by default and common firewall applications installed with frequent updates from a greatly funded and well known organization being Fedora Project/Red Hat, following with great documentation about further hardening security and basic pracitices with also recent vulnerabilities/issues being posted. Further speaking of documentation, I'd say it's decent and large enough and getting even more extensive with it expanding rapidly since it's recent rise in popularity the past couple of years. So finding support without having to risk asking a question on a platform to get b****ed at by the toxic portion of the community is a great aspect to consider. Not saying this is unique to Fedora Linux, but any major desktop Linux operating system has great support and documentation so common issues can be quickly/easily remedied, Fedora is a great example as well as Ubuntu, Debian, and OpenSUSE. Getting drivers and utilizing proprietary hardware is easy to enable and set up (literally a menu with some options to tick in RPM manager) so getting Nvidia drivers isn't a massive headache of a hunt to go through and get then to install if you need it. The community with Fedora luckily hasn't been as bad/toxic of an experience when having to ask for help and general questions on their OFFICIAL platforms/forums and the like, not saying they don't exist every community/group has that aspect but as said previously mentioned this doesn't seem to be as often. Another mention I'd like to mention is switching desktop environments is pretty much an absolute breeze and can get the most up to date version (I usually main Cinnamon) and default packs the most up to date GNOME which I'd argue is now a great experience in it's own right. And of course it's official page leads to spins you can download which is just base Fedora but with a different DE loaded if you're a bit lazy.

Another issue is that it does not go to next step if an additional partition for boot/efi is not created/not available!I am currently using debian based Emmabuntus and I want another one RPM based distro. The fedora and many based on it demand a similar situation for installation as stated above, that is they all have the common installer, anaconda, and it does not make a difference what the distro is, if it is based on RPM. I just tried nobara and it meets the same end."
1002,2022-12-01, Fedora, 37,9,10,"I recommend Fedora, because it is getting better and better with each release, but without any major unpleasant surprises. It is very open source focused, so some things may seem like an unpleasant surprise, but then you understand the reasons and it seems fine. Anyways, there are always some workarounds.I feel that Fedora also listens to the community very much. Those who make decisions about this distro listen to the community feedback, and the distro seems to be very coherent with needs of professionals and enthusiasts who use Fedora.Fedora users and developers care and love this distro, that is why the releases may be delayed, so the system is released with everything secure and working fine,It is very stable, works fine on my Dell laptop. I installed workstation, but I am very interested to test and use Silverblue for a while, and other versions. With new ARM and CoreOS versions Fedora is adding to its own ""ecosystem"".I recommend this distro, but it is not for super beginners. You need to know how to configure it fine. Once it is configured, it will work perfectly well, the updates do not break (from my experience in previous years)."

I bought, after running an I5 for 10-12 to years. an I7-12700, and I bought it because it was rehabbed  and it was a good price. I had some problems with cheap flash drives and errors, so testing is not completed, but so far Fedora 37 is the first distro that sort of works except for sound, but I think that may be fixed soon.  I was very surprised because it was the first distro to work and I tried several.  I also tested some rolling releases, and ClearOS, but the rolling releases did not have live ones to try, and I had problems with Etcher failing and trusting it when it worked.  I am running Ubuntu on the I5, and Tumbleweed on a laptop.  It may be amusing to know that when it started working I saw so many distros that I thought it rebooted and that Windows 11 was running, but it was not and it was Fedora 37 after all. Because I thought Windows 11 was working and I had no sound I tried to fix it and then I tried all my old headsets including usb ones, playing with sound, and trying to fix the speakers.  Finally when I could not solve the problem, I had no recourse, but to give up trying to fix the problem and reboot Windows and hope that solved the problem, only then I noticed it was not Windows 11, but Fedora that was running."

Fedora does everything right: it has the stability and dependability of Debian, it has the speed to install packages and update like Arch. I have had no problems with Wi-Fi, hardware, or printer. All good, all fast on the Cinammon desktop (I don't like Gnome). Like Debian or Opensuse, you have to configure things after installing the distro, but learning is very easy (it's not Gentoo). I have 4 different distros on my pc sharing the ""home"" folder: arch, debian, opensuse and fedora. On another pc I have gentoo. I give fedora a 10.

Devuan chimaera dual boots with Windows(tm) without problems on a Dell 15-3511 Inspiron Laptop.To boot Windows: 1 Select Windows as first in boot order. 2 Select RAID in the Storage section. 3 Save and Exit BIOS.To boot Devuan: 1 Select Devuan as first in boot order. 2 Select AHCI in the Storage section. 3 Save and Exit BIOS.If you mess up the boot procedure, go back to the BIOS immediately (power off if necessary) and do it right (as shown above). Do not let the system attempt repairing or troubleshooting anything.Note that everything from wireless to 120Hz 1080p works in Linux (No 120Hz in Windows) LINUX RULES.Devuan works as well as any OS in the Debian lineage. The main shortcoming is the Debian repository of outdated packages requiring you to build some newer packages on your own, or installing Flatpak(tm). Another Debian shortcoming is you must configure your own nftables firewall (Why is there not a safe default firewall for newbies?).Also, install the non-free video drivers.Note that some Debian packages like VICE and MAME are stripped of non-free stuff which makes the packages easier to build from a tarball than to manually copy the non-free stuff from the tarball into your file system after you've installed the stripped Debian package.The good thing about Linux is that things work the way you expect after they are configured.I only boot into Windows for the distraction, and to upgrade the drivers. There are no worthwhile applications that Linux doesn't have.Devuan is the One True operating system for laptops, desktops, servers, and computers, for the benefit of all."
1007,2023-07-10, Devuan GNU+Linux, testing,10,18,"Thank you for another excellent review. I am using Version 5, which may be a release candidate. What might be interesting to other Linux users is that I have booted and used Devuan 5 on my recently purchased Dell Inspiron 2910, with Windows 11 as its solely installed OS, secure boot enabled.This is a quad core running at 4.0 GHz, with 8 GB RAM. I have Devuan on an externally connected SATA hard drive that contains 15 Linux distributions as reported by ""os-prober"" and thus far it is the only Linux distro of the 15 that boots on this machine. Its grub is listed in the boot options as ""Debian,"" exactly as I had previously named it. This is a splendid distro for an experienced user who wants to get things done.No fancy bells and whistles, just tools that work.I am especially impressed with its file browser, which allows me to browse all of my owned directories, a feature not available on many Debian distros. I gave it a rating of 10 based on its reliability, ease of startup, and usefulness. After all, I am here to use my computer, not bang it with a hammer. Usually, I boot my Linux on a separate Dell, an Optiplex 9020, which I bought refurbishedwithin the last year. It is a tad slower at 3.x GHz, also 8 GB RAM. Usually that ""Linux drive"" is attached to the older (Optiplex) tower. I call it my Linux machine because the Windows 10 it camewith, having had its boot repaired a number of times, simply has booted Windows for its last time.I have used ""Boot Repair"" and ""Rescatux"" from their respective flash drives to do the necessary boot repairs. It's hard to justify the need for Windows when so many Ubuntu and Debian-baseddistributions can be used with ease. I would not recommend Devuan for a user new to Linux,but it works for me."
1008,2023-06-30, Devuan GNU+Linux, 4.0.0,10,35,"This review is based on my use of Devuan Beowulf and Chimaera.I tend to see Devuan as ""Debian Improved"", essentially a course correction of Debian. I switched to Devuan during the days of Debian Stretch as I wanted a more traditional approach to Linux. Since I didn't have the time to look into other distros too deeply, I ended up choosing Devuan because it is still largely compatible with Debian, allowing for a painless switch.Since Devuan tracks Debian, you'll get access to the tools you're familiar with. Much of the documentation written for Debian equally applies to Devuan. You also get access to the wealth of packages provided by Debian, with very little delay. If you're used to Debian, installing Devuan will be a breeze. Of course, no distro is perfect, and the very fact that Devuan tracks Debian is both a strength and a potential weakness. You need to be aware that the project's primary focus is to be a Debian-compatible distro without systemd. Devuan still relies on Debian to a considerable degree, and some of the more unfortunate upstream decisions made by Debian may still find their way into Devuan. Devuan currently is not a standalone distro unlike, say, Slackware. Nevertheless, I've learned a lot about Linux from using Devuan, and thanks to its flexibility you can pretty much make it your own, doing things the way you see fit, albeit within the Debian paradigm. I would recommend Devuan to anyone who is used to Debian-based distros and want a more oldschool Debian-style approach to Linux. Particularly great for intermediate to advanced Linux users. One of the best distros available in current year. Give it a shot."
1009,2023-06-16, Devuan GNU+Linux, 4.0.0,9,41,"As others have said Devuan is a great distro and easily solves the problem of SystemD in Debian-based systems.Although Bookworm is now stable I am holding out until Daedalus is officially released (I've tested it on another PC and it's really good), going to miss using Chimaera after 2-3 happy years on it, though I could also stay a while longer....Anyway things just work right outta the box, hardly ever in my years of running a Linux system have I had to ""fix"" anything of significance. Debian/Devuan always makes it super simple to do.One thing I did not like about Debian's Bullseye (what Chimaera is based on), the switch from GTK2 to GTK3, themes looked very strange unless they had appropriate GTK3 CSS files.Not only that but it made things feel heavier and slower, not much though. Again this is not Devuan's fault or Debian's; GTK2 has been deprecated upstream and that's the price you pay for wanting to stay more ""recent"" to keep enjoying FOSS."
1010,2023-06-15, Devuan GNU+Linux, testing,10,116,"I am on Devuan 5 Daedalus, which is technically already stable (Debian 12 Bookworm is out now). It's a great systemd-free distro that uses sysvinit instead, or you can replace it with runit or openrc if you have a different preference. Just like actual Debian, it can be custom-tailored to your own needs, from beginner to expert.Pros- Upgrading to Daedalus from Chimaera (happened back in January) was seamless- Excellent, helpful, and supportive community that will assist you with your issues- Literally Debian without systemd (and it works without issues, including services like network-manager that depend on it)- Works GREAT on older and newer hardware alike- Rock-solid stability and RAM consumption is rather low or medium compared to other distros (depending on DE/WM and background processes, but I could get Xfce 4.18 at under 400 MB on a cold boot on an 8 GB system)- Because it's based on Debian, almost any DEB package should work with Devuan (except the ones that pull systemd in; that's the main focus)- This is my personal opinion, but the lack of interest in going along with the usrmerge (which Debian voted in favor of) is part of why I prefer using this distro over mainline Debian- Even with packages like elogind, you can remove it and replace it with consolekit2, seatd, and/or dummy-logind (this ensures you can keep your logind-dependent packages while elogind isn't running anywhere on your system)- Xfce, MATE, Cinnamon, KDE Plasma, LXDE, LXQt, and Openbox are all working great on Devuan- Refracta tools consist of an installer (default for Devuan; much better than Calamares), USB ISO writer, and a snapshot creatorCons- Very small team of volunteers/maintainers, so sometimes a systemd-related bug might take a while to patch and then reupload (takes about 6 hours to appear on the merged repo)- Sometimes, the round-robin repository (deb.devuan.org) doesn't work right or takes too long to fetch updates; not a problem if you use a dedicated mirror close to home- Prefer to use the IRC channel over the forums for support (forums are too quiet)"
1011,2023-06-11, Devuan GNU+Linux, 4.0.0,10,16,"Devuan does take time to configure on a Lenovo Ideapad 3 laptop.  But, once it gets going it works smoothly.  I prefer point release distros, because there is less time spent doing updates.  Upgrading to a new major version of Devuan is not too hard.   If, runit is chosen for the init system; the operating system boots fast.  Systemd is not needed.  However, I have to build Whatsie from source, because the package which is a snap, has a systemd dependency.  The GNOME desktop is not available due to it having systemd as a dependency."
1012,2023-06-07, Devuan GNU+Linux, 4.0.0,10,5,"It works. It respects you as an adult. It does not take weird decisions on your benefit. What was expected to be Linux. That is Devuan.I need to write lots of more chars, but in fact there is no more explication needed. You get what Debian used to be, you get tons of packages, and you do not get the ""ubuntu feeling"" that latests Debian gives you. But with all the benefits of Debian.Actualiced packages without surprises, and nothing that systemd surprisinly breaks, or any package that breacks systemd and left systemd broken."
1013,2023-06-01, Devuan GNU+Linux, testing,10,15,"I have been using Linux since some time in the 90's and previously used (not in any particular order & likely forgetting some) Suse, Caldera, Slackware, Sidux, PCLinuxOS, MX, Ubuntu, Mint, Debian, LFS, BLFS, Vector, CentOS, Fedora, Bodhi, Peppermint, Mepis, TwistedOS, Raspian, Tails amongst various others that I have tried briefly or used as they are on computers. Others in my family are using PopOS, MX, Xubuntu.When Devuan were working on Jessie (1,0.0) I was mostly using Debian and I have long preferred apt to rpm. I maintain servers which I am gradually moving to devuan from debian and one ubuntu although I have used centos in the past. My concern has mostly been systemd. I have used runit before and use openrc on my devuan installs which at the time of making the choice seemed to have the edge to me but the choice is always there. What I like about Devuan is the freedom from systemd feature creep and the risks that come with that but also the mindset of the team that goes with that choice that the developer made which is a reassurance in future decision making. It has installed easily on a variety of hardware and I am using Chimaera (4.0.0.) for servers and Daedalus (Testing) for the more up to date hardware support for my laptop.Although I am capable of doing a lot of the more technical under the hood stuff, when I am busy I like a quick setup, ease of use (whether terminal or GUI) and for stuff to just work well without hassle when i need to get on with things and I get that with Devuan. I find it very solid and reliable with a huge amount of software available but without bloat. It's compact efficient and fast. It's simple to just grab the stuff I like to use and install it and copy over my profiles where needed when changing hardware.I use XFCE almost always but deep down I'm an enlightenment / Moksha fan really but i would spend a while making it how i wanted it whereas XFCE is close enough for me to work efficiently with few tweaks out of the box and most distros have an up to date version. I have used KDE a lot in my early years with the odd short term use of LXDE, Gnome, Cinnamon, Mate, Budgie, FVWM, Openbox, IceWM, LXQT. Occasionally I have used wine but I almost always find there is a linux way of sorting stuff. I think the last time I had to resort to that was for a vehicle maintenance program quite a while back. I'm not a gamer and I do see from my son's gaming that sometimes there are some disadvantages to linux whether under wine or native. I can't recall when I last had a dual boot setup but I think it was probably soon after my wife got her Samsung NC20 netbook so probably 2009 and I hoped she would let me use it on the rare occasions I wanted do do something in windows. Before that I was at the stage of being many months between windows boots.I think the most frustrating thing is document compatibility if printing something that has been done on a windows machine and the appropriate fonts are not installed and maybe even not legally available as they came with something else so at least one needs to find a metrically compatible substitute but this issue can potentially occur between windows systems to an extent. The other thing is I hope in future they pick release names that are easier to remember the spelling. I'm not bothered about the lack of wallpapers as all my desktops are always covered with open windows and they are easy to add what you like if you want anyway.Over the years I have liked, enjoyed and disliked different distros but Devuan is the one I feel I can trust & rely on the most to do what I need and I feel at ease with."
1014,2023-05-21, Devuan GNU+Linux, 4.0.0,10,16,"A ""perfect distro"" is very  subjective.Devuan has been the perfect distro for me.I have been using linux way back when synaptic was the graphical package manager and before systemd was thought of.While I do not desire to enter the systemd dabate all I can say is the more I use it the more I see the sense in do one thing and doing it well. I chose Devaun for my main machine after a year and half with Qubes. Qubes is great but I wanted a more integrated system. Devaun was one of three distros I have used in the past and only replaced them after hardware failure. (the other two were mxlinux and mint).After a year of so Devaun just keeps booting and doing what it needs to do. Not that I have stopped distro-hopping. I still try distros on spare drives and machines however while other distros have come and gone Devaun remains. What may be perceived as cons does not bother me. There is not graphical package manager. However as Install through the command line anyway I do not miss it. App seems to boot faster and the system remains stable longer anyway.Packages are not bleeding edge. This is an acceptable trade off for a system that remains stable day after day.I can't remember if it has a welcome screen or not however once again everything that usually pops up in a welcome screen is part of the normal routine of installation anyway.Devuan is a perfect distro if need something that boots everyday and works."
1015,2023-04-21, Devuan GNU+Linux, 4.0.0,10,32,"Devuan 4.0 Chimaera  XFCE (installed from LiveCD)Stable as a rock :)Pros:- very fast- very easy to use- rock solid- small size- very simple management- debian based (meaning that you can easily install vscode, chrome, zoom, discord and other apps from their sites) Cons:- cause it has small size (literarily 1GB)   you need to install every additonal thing yourself  there is literarily only one theme, 8 boring wallpapers.  so you need to find a dark theme yourself  install localisation packages for FF & libreoffice  install a decent mail client   and you are good to go.  but its ok :)"
1016,2023-04-21, Devuan GNU+Linux, 4.0.0,10,90,"I have been running Devuan on all our production servers since Debian decided to swich to systemd and I am very satisfied.Devuan just works. Devuan is stable, Devuan is simple.Easy step by step installation, that lets you create a minimal system to start with, then you can easily add programs you need. You can use precompiled packages but it works flawlessly with packages you compile yourself. For web stack I usually use supplied MariaDB with nginx and php compiled from source. It is extremely easy and fast to set up this way. There is no painful fiddling or trial and error.You do not have to deal with the big black box called systemd, so everything is refreshingly simple a and easy to inspect or change.The power of Devuan is the combination of the Debian with its easy package system while avoiding systemd complexity to keep the modularity and simplicity that Debian used to have.Highly recommended."
1017,2023-04-17, Devuan GNU+Linux, 4.0.0,9,5,"I'm using Devuan for a couple of years now and still love it.I switched to Devuan when Manjaro (Arch Linux derivate) stopped supporting a non-systemd version, and some disappointing trials with Artix and other alternatives. My biggest requirements for a distro are that it is systemd-free and that it provides a modern enough Emacs version. After trying Devuan Live I was immediately sold. It is very stable, works great and doesn't need much maintenance.Installing is pretty easy, post-install requires a little more effort.Some default software is a little strange, buggy or childish and some very usefull software is missing, for example fdisk or gparted, and rcconf, but removing & installing is easy.I use/used it on different (relative old) laptops and most of my hardware works out of the box, even the multi-media keys.I encountered very few issues with Devuan and could solve all, some with always very friendly and adequate help on IRC chat, which doubled my love for Devuan."

Before that, I encountered systemd related issues, which made the decision along with my support of the UNIX philosophy to switch easier.Currently running laptops and two data servers on ""rolling"" stable tag, previously laptops on unstable tag without issues for certain software packages.Pro:- Continuation of the original Debian philosophy and its stable environment including packages- Optional minimalistic first installCons:- Missing a couple of packages (related to the next point) that I installed through deb files from the Debian repository, not sure if they're also obsolete there- None other that come to mind other than the common Linux bassed shortcomings from lack of support by manufactorsThis is pretty much an ""install and forget"" distribution, although I do manual updates to avoid surprises with automated updates. The OS does not stand in the way in my daily use as one should expect."

I really loved Artix, but switched because of the occasional stability issue (the system would break once every two months or so), and for ability to easily use .deb packages.  So far, Devuan has been fantastic:Pros:+ Systemd free+ Very stable (even in testing, though I'd like to use it longer to reach a proper conclusion)+ .deb support+ Easy package management generally+ Clear install materials (some people complained about this, but I didn't find it challenging)Cons:- On install, the default disk configuration provided too little swap; had to customize- One program I use stopped distributing .deb (ungoogled-chromium)--obviously me/package-specificOverall, it's a great distro for daily use!"

One SSD has Windows 11 and the other SSD was blank and was the target for Devuan. I could not figure out how to point the Devuan installer to the empty SSD that was the target. Recommend the development team revisit the installation process while keeping in mind a user might be a beginner or intermediate level user. It is my opinion the current installation process is definitely not for a beginner. It might be fine for someone who does not have any operating system installed on their computer but otherwise I recommend a non-advanced user to avoid."

It loads superfast, faster than Debian. I think it's because systemd doesn't run along, but I don't know nor do I care that much. Devuan is a great piece of software that really is growing on me. There are a few “buts” that new Linux users might take note. If you expect Devuan to be aesthetically pleasing first time you load it, you might be a little disappointed, because vanilla looks isn't sexy, and it might look a bit oldish. But Cinnamon (or MATE or XFCE) is fairly easy to customize through its Themes section, and you can make it look as modern as Linux Mint or Ubuntu or whatever. I am running a couple of Mints own Cinnamon themes and I really like how it looks. Recently I installed Devuan via expert install, and I went for minimal Cinnamon installation. Now, after installing all the necessary packages (gvfs, fuse, ntfs-3g) plus the programs I use the most: Firefox, Brave (for work), Audacious, Filezilla, qbittorrent, Pdfarranger, Gimp, Timeshift, Simplescreenrecorder, Grsync, Gnome-disk-utility (Disks), Scribus, Celluloid, Libreoffice Writer, I have a lean, mean super Devuan machine with less than 1300 packages. With Mint I always had appx. 2200 packages, with Debian around 1900. Not that it matters much, but I like that.Oh, and if you for some reason have a low resolution on your desktop, just hit sudo apt install firmware-amd-graphics, and after reboot you will have good resolution back. I really think Devuan should include this firmware, but it is not a big problem - if you know how to solve it. It took me some time to find this out. :)  It is a bit of a rough diamond, but if you invest some time and interest, Devuan will serve you faithfully."

I think this reflects well on both the Devs of Devuan and the parent Debian.Devuan Stable is very usable by almost anyone with a cursory understanding of Linux, the rolling nature of Ceres is a little more demanding.I think the big attraction for me is the fact that most of Debian's extensive repo offerings are available in Devuan, but without the curse of systemd.

1029,2022-10-02, Devuan GNU+Linux, unstable,10,17,"After Microsoft started to implement ads into file explorer I decided I needed to cut my losses with them and switch to open-source software.I initially wanted an Arch based distro, but after having those be too unstable for me I determined a Debian based was the best course in terms of usability and stability (I say that as I'm on the testing/unstable branch lol).After determining Debian was the best course I heard about SystemD and it's Corporate overlords that control it and I decided I didn't want to be beholden to the Microsoft of the Linux world, so naturally Devuan popped up, and after trying Chimaera the Stable branch I realized the Wayland support it gave was sub par, I also wanted a newer kernel than 5.10 due to the AMDGPU driver having better support somewhere around 5.12-5.13.Now I'm running ""Daedalus/Ceres"" from the NetInstaller and it's been exactly what I wanted.My system specs are as follow:Motherboard: ASUS TUF Gaming X570 Plus Wi-FiCPU: Ryzen 9 5950XCooler: Corsair H150i Elite Capellix (360mm AIO)RAM: 128GiB G.Skill DDR4-3600MHZ CL16Storage: 500GiB Samsung 980 Pro (1GiB EFI, 499GiB Root)Storage: 1TiB Samsung 980 Pro (1TiB Home)Storage: 128GiB Kingston A400 (SWAP)Storage: 1TiB Samsung 860 Evo (250GiB Timeshift Backups, 750GiB Virtual Machines)Storage: x2 4TiB Samsung 870 Evo (Games)GPU: MSI Gaming X Trio - AMD/ATI Radeon RX 6900XTPSU: Corsair RM1000X 80+ GoldCase: Corsair 4000D Mid-TowerMy Steam games work perfectly through proton (besides the ones that refuse to give support), the AMDGPU driver from the non-free repo works flawlessly and allows for Ray Tracing on games that support it, eliminates screen tearing and allows for variable refresh rate on high-end gaming monitors. Multi-monitor support is fast and stable even without Wayland and my games get upwards of 120FPS.Everything I want to do works with hardly any issues. The only two I've come across over the last 2 months of daily driving this is system logs were filling up my root drive with upwards of 300GiB, but after re-configuring logrotate it's fixed the issue and my root storage has yet to go above 20GiB with all that I do. The other issue (that has since been fixed) was the keyring expiration which was fixed with an updated package from the main repo. Other than that this OS has had no issues and runs flawlessly.This is exactly what I wanted for an OS that I plan to use for the next 7 years when I plan to upgrade."

Not too long after that, he linked me to a video called ""MGTOW of linux: Curing the Cancer."" This was a video about how SoystainD was nothing but spyware and really no different than winblows. He said he was using Devuan (specifically a fork, Refracta) and it didnt have that soystainD garbage infecting his PC. Thats when I switched.Being that I started on refracta 10 (which is Devuan Beowulf) and that I needed Japanese input, the fresh install of Devuan was a chore to get Japanese input to work right (I was using a Japanese site to guide me through the process). That was a PITA, but once I got it all set up, there wasnt a single issue afterwards. *****the japanese language install is MUCH better in Chimaera, much smoother process and less issues than I had.My friend then recommended I switch to unstable as its basically just as stable as stable is, but you get updates sooner. I bought in and I have been using it ever since. I currently have two DEs installed, XFCE (base install with devuan) and Trinity. I switch between the two and i really like both of them, although I'm still not used to a lot of the things that KDE does differently than gnome, but thats why I kept XFCE installed, just so i can take my time getting used to Trinity then I can make a full move over to it in the future.I kept SysVInit as my init system as people complain that its ""old"" or whatever, but if it works, it works. I havent had a single problem with it so I plan to stick with it.I also have Devuan installed on my Thinkpad X200S with a core 2 duo. Runs amazingly well.I am so happy my friend told me about Devuan. I never had a need to distrohop thanks to this reliable distro."

Quick and easy to set up. It's not a mainstream please everyone, but so very close.  It'll need just a couple minor tweaks if you're used to a vanilla ubuntu, to get you comfortable, but it is (very) comfortable. I really enjoy the xfce desktop.  I just had to tweak repos setting to get maintenance updates configured around my missing usb installer image, and proceeded to package installs and some user security settings for myself, simple to do.  Reason for trying:  1. check out non systemd , 2.  ubuntu unable to use my firefox profile when installing a newer maint release with a migrated /home so I used this to get by, and recover via a cloned /home.  Thanks very much :). It is little effort only for a transition and if you're familiar with any other distro, you should have no qualms with testing this one out.    Currently dual booting it with a sandbox for testing backup sw which is also debian based.  For me the transition to non-systemd was a curiosity for some time. This has been painless thus far.  Previously this system was a ubuntu/xcfe based dual boot with Win and remains fixed disk based. I have no benchmarks but it feels snappier.  Could be that previously I was using low latency kernels that would behave differently on task focus.  It looks to be a keeper for me and I will certainly look deeper into adopting for my daily driver laptop.

The few times I have needed to use System-D based Debian for clients, I have had issues, and it appears to boot slower (not an issue on a server which takes 7 minutes to go through a hardware check).I stuck with Sys-V on my servers since I know it fairly well, but Devuan also allows you to run several other init systems, some of which are better for specific applications.

Why does a free distribution with the slogan ""Software freedom, your way"" have non-free packages by default and include non-free repositories?    2. If you install Devuan for example with Xfce from the installer, and not manually from the console, then it is impossible to completely remove the default browser. When you uninstall Firefox, Epiphany is installed, when you uninstall Epiphany, Firefox is installed.But this is just my opinion and every system has errors and bugs.

Can run, for example:sudo service network-manager restart- Wasn't clear what the bootstraping is on this arm-type architecture (BIOS/EFI?), but eventually found a simple file for this:/boot/cmdline.txt- For apparmor to work on startup, add lsm=""apparmor"" to /boot/cmdline.txt command line.- Only Firefox-ESR is offered on chimaera version (tracks bullseye from Debian), so not the cuttting edge version of FF.- It might freeze up for c.a minute sometimes (less than every other day though used extensively nearly each day), maybe due to some trojan horse imported from earlier systems into my backup files?  This PI 400 only has 4Gb RAM;  it has been said that PIs aren't for desktops, though I use my PI 400 happily as one.- Redshift not working on arm architecture when last checked; just set colours on my monitor to Red on high, etc. and raise monitor's brightness and contrast settings during daytime.  Apparently issue only applies to arm architecture, not amd64.- No response to 1-3 issues filed at Bugs.Devuan.org page or bug report system.PROS:- Very stable other than the occasional freeze mentioned above.- Better than tolerating the blob within systemd e.g. as offered with Raspberry OS- Apparently, there is a choice of runit, OpenRC or SysVinit, but I settled with whatever came out-of-the-box.  - Fast boot up of 20 seconds, roughly speaking.- Reasonably good development base, considering also that it is based on Debian.All considered, very happy, better to my Raspberry PI 400 experience with Raspberry OS, though Raspberry OS is reasonably good overall.On amd64 desktop, I had previously used (in order of preference):  PopOS (excellent, but I prefer to avoid systemd), Qubes OS, Debian, Ubuntu, Calculate Linux (Gentoo derivative), Alpine OS, Void OS, and others.I prefer Devuan overall, though beginners (on an amd64 computer) would be more comfortable with Linux Lite OS or Pop OS, in my humble opinion."
1039,2022-04-13, Devuan GNU+Linux, unstable,10,1031,"Running Devuan Ceres (unstable) for two years on all my machines. Everything works and I'm amazed by how close to upstream these packages are. As of this review, I got the 5.16 kernel and haven't had any issues. Nonetheless, I installed Apt-listbugs, just to be safe. Updating your packages is super easy with the help of Amprolla. Devuan maintains a list of banned packages to prevent the bloated horror that is Systemd from making its way onto your systems, and packages that have some Systemd parts to them are either banned alongside or forked by Devuan and will be distributed to you shortly.The only complaint I have is Runit is still partially implemented, but this is more of a Debian problem than Devuan. It works as init (powering on and off), but service scripts are still largely SysVinit-based. Hopefully, Ceres users like myself will get newer builds of Runit that are less dependent on SysVinit as soon as possible.To summarize, Devuan is exactly what Debian USED to be, but I hope it becomes its own thing soon because there's more to GNU/Linux than just the bases of Ubuntu, Arch GNU/Linux, or Gentoo. Seeing as promising distros such as Hyperbola have switched out of Linux entirely in favor of OpenBSD, it's good to know there are still safe GNU/Linux distros to use which don't depend on Systemd. Artix GNU/Linux, for example, is Arch GNU/Linux sans Systemd, just as Devuan is Debian sans Systemd. More and more of these non-Systemd forks need to proliferate, as Systemd itself has spread like a virus that is near-impossible to get rid of.Let's go, Devuan!"

1043,2022-03-07, Devuan GNU+Linux, 4.0.0,9,13,"Distro hopping should end at Debian, but that uses systemd (by default), making Devuan the clear choice. Devuan's net installer works just like Debian's, but it also includes the proprietary wireless firmware also found in Debian's ""unofficial/non-free"" ISO. You choose from a list of popular desktop environments (GNOME noticeably absent due to systemd dependencies), and at the end you choose your init system (sysvinit is standard, runit is a good alternative, and openrc still not a complete implementation). A clean installation comes fully loaded with all the apps you'll need, and probably a lot  that you don't need. Removing some pre-installed packages can cause dependency issues, but that's also an issue on Debian. If you want a true minimal install, don't select a desktop environment and install it later, with just the packages you need.I had to install video drivers, but other than that, everything has worked out of the box on both of my machines. I run KDE and xfce, both with sysvinit. The strength of Devuan (and Debian) is that it's incredibly stable, with lots of support for adding in whatever you need. I don't see the point in upgrading to the testing or unstable branches, but those are available to those who want newer packages. I know I have two machines that aren't going to fail on me due to a random update or crash constantly due to under-tested, beta-level software. And, neither of them run systemd, which I find undesirable on a GNU/Linux system, along with proprietary software (with the exception of firmware).

It has everything great about Debian - the stability, fantastic package management, good support, but without SystemD. Even if you don't mind it, choice is still a good thing, especially now more than ever, considering that SystemD is used on most Linux distributions. My only gripe with Devuan is the installer. It would be nice if a more modern installer like the Calamares installer was offered. Also it would be nice if an option for the non-root to be added to sudo on installation was given.  Pros* The main selling point of Devuan, allows for three different init systems instead of just being locked into SystemD.* One of the few distros that still well supports x86. Great for reviving old computers. * Rather user-friendly once you get it up and running. I installed this for a family member on an old Thinkpad x61 and they absolutely loved it. * Extremely stable, maybe even more so than Debian, due to the lack of SystemD. Cons* The installer is rather confusing. Especially for beginners. Please consider adding the Calamares installer. * This con also applies to Debian, but sometimes packages have tons of unneeded dependencies. I remember being a tad annoyed when I learned that the default web browser can't be removed due to being a dependency of the desktop environment. * Because Devuan doesn't have SystemD, this means that some packages won't work with it. Most notably GNOME 3 and Snap.I give Devuan a 10/10, simply because it's the best Linux distro I've used yet. It's not perfect, especially with the installer, but it's very solid otherwise. I heavily recommend it to anyone looking for a stable distro that doesn't use SystemD. If you want more cutting edge, look into Artix. "

So I can say that either from scratch, or coming from previous versions, the result is a well configured and stable system.I like it very much for its stability, simplicity, I haven't had problems to install any software that I have needed till now.Not having systemd as a startup system has not influenced the software I use.I guess for those who Gnome 3 (or 40) is a must, it's different.As I have never liked Gnome 3 or higher it is not a problem.I prefer MATE as a desktopI use it on my servers as well as on my PCs, and I'm very happy with it."

It won't do any Repair of the Startup issue, because it cannot find the existing Windows 10 installation. (But it reads all the drives and their folder structure, although with some arbitrary drive letters, e.g. X: (Boot).)Conclusion: Immature, no GUI Live medium nor installer, and it breaks other things.Recommendation: Stay away (unless you are The Skynet and know what you are doing)!...The worst distro that I've ever tried from DistroWatch, by the way!..."

I have been a Debian user for over 10 years now, all servers and home workstations have always been running Debian.  But sometimes I also use BSD systems, and lately they have been of interest to me.  DragonflyBSD looks like a very interesting alternative to Free/Open/Net, with very promising features of its Hammer file system (especially in my case after my experience with OpenBSD, although it has its advantages. I decided to try DragonflyBSD as a desktop for everyday use and  I was surprised, but also very disappointed.I usually use KDE Plasma with the presence of all its original components.And what a disappointment that the current version contains a broken SDDM login manager.It was very sad to find out that the packages received into the system are not tested and do not pass any tests  , this is a very bad sign and any trust in everything else disappears, just as it turned out on the example of a recent sitation with wireguard in FreeBSD :( But I still recommend trying it at least as a file server (NFS, Samba, sftp, etc  Especially its alternative to the usual sofware raid implementation will surprise you greatly DragonflyBSD is a very fast system, with quite fast burst  manager, especially if you switch the repository to the mirror closest to you - it will be very good.

Nomad-BSD is an amazingly easy way to try FreeBSD.  My upload and download speeds have greatly improved over any Linux systems I have used in the past, and I have tried many versions.  Since this recent installation, it is my daily driver.  All of the installed programs operate without a single flaw, and those programs appear to load and start faster on Nomad-BSD than on any Linux system I used in the past.  Google-Chrome, a Linux version running on Nomad-BSD, starts faster than on Linux.  Even LibreOffice runs smoother and faster on Nomad-BSD.  All of the regular applications from KDE, Gnome, Mate, and XFCE run flawlessly in Nomad-BSD.Nomad-BSD automatically installed my HP printer and my videocam as it installed the operating system on my 22-year-old Dell-Studio i-7 desktop.  It is obvious that many improvements have been made to the latest installation software.  Even though Nomad-BSD will operate on a USB card, I strongly recommend installing to your hard-drive if you want the true speed of Nomad-BSD."
1064,2023-04-04, NomadBSD, 131r,10,1,"If you have an older video card, watch out.  The first thing you need to do is edit /etc/rc.conf.  Change kld_list=""radeonkms"" and reboot your system.  All the error messages go away, and your video card works properly.  My i-7 literally flies and everything works as it should.  Once that is done, install it.  You will be amazed at how fast your system runs.  By the way, don't install any programs until you put Nomad onto your hard drive.  Why, because it works slowly on a stick.  Since installing it onto my hard drive, downloading and uploading has also improved.  This is FreeBSD at its best, in my opinion.  Sadly, I spent hours attempting to get FreeBSD 13.1 to run on my Dell Studio XPS 8100.  This unit was built in 2009, and FreeBSD no longer supports their original video drivers.  Instead, FreeBSD uses a video driver, Cuse for BSD.  That driver causes the video cards to run faster than designed, and the cards stop working because of over-heating.  After setting this up, I won't be returning to Linux anytime in the near future.  My distro hopping days are over.  I am willing to bet that GhostBSD, NomadBSD, and many other BSD have seen numerous complaints since updating to FreeBSD 13.1's official release, and this single issue of the video card driver is responsible for causing all the error messages.  "
1065,2023-02-06, NomadBSD, 131r,10,3,Very polished system and uses very little resources.  Runs fast and was easy to install.  The install does everythig for you.  All of the peripherals were recognized and they worked perfectly out of the box.  The system is very stable and i have not had any issues with it.  The openbox window manager looks very nice and professional. Everything is easy to make it look the way you want.  It is easy for those who want to transition to BSD and not have to worry about things not working.  Recommend to anyone.
1066,2023-01-27, NomadBSD, 131r,7,3,"TL;DR This is the only ""what""BSD that interested me because it features persistence on external USB disk. I tried it once, before the Dec-2022 update but it was less usable than it is now. Either way, it cannot recognize the touchpad of my 10-year-old budget HP laptop.It takes a fairly long time to start, like any Linux with KDE Plasma maybe except EndeavourOS or Q4OS LOL. After it asked me for specific settings such as keyboard layout, it asked me to reboot. I did so, in single-user mode but it went right into the desktop without asking me for the password. Is that normal?It seems to behave like Linux system equipped with a window manager. Right-button mouse click on panel to close a program won't be to everyone's taste. Recalling a new panel ""theme"" with ""Tint2"", to change its settings is very slow. For one of them I only wanted to change its position, because both the panel and ""Plank"" were at the bottom.It consistently runs hot on the left-hand side of my 10-year-old laptop.  I have a lot of trouble getting any Linux installation to be alike.It comes with some programs such as Geany (better than the editor proposed in the initial setup) and VLC (which is garbage in any distro), but no office suite. It's because the file system ""image"" is already 4GB uncompressed. Web browser is Firefox (with ""UBlock Origin"" preinstalled!) but probably a different one could be installed. This OS also comes with the ""older"" release of Thunar (ie. no split view and customizable keystroke shortcuts). To view PDF files there's Qpdfview which absurdly, is located in the AUR in Arch Linux world. I did the full-system update with OctoPkg. It took a long time to finish. Before that the OctoPkg was on the dock on the bottom of the screen, but it took itself off. It seems it is set to display packages already installed on the system, and I have to open web browser to ""FreeBSD ports"" site or whatever to discover what else could be installed.The DSBMC doesn't seem to find all the partitions of my computer, in particular of an internal hard disk when the system is booted via external USB. It came up with ESP, the C: drive of Windows and other NTFS partitions but missed one of the ""ext4"" partitions (32-bit Slackware) probably because the latter doesn't have an EFI entry. (I was unable to boot this system itself via UEFI which is interesting.) The app to mount partitions doesn't recall disk or partition labels which could put off somebody not confident working with an Unix-like OS.I wish I could disable the stupid animations which are for small children.  The Handbook is pretty good, might be too brief, could be read offline but unfortunately some information such as that for DSBMC and for using Linux programs causes an online visit. I should spend weeks with this system to be able to give more useful information that would satisfy an ""expert"". This was for NomadBSD for 64-bit and ""ZFS""."
1067,2022-12-16, NomadBSD, 131r,9,3,"I am surprised that there aren't yet any reviews of the latest release. OVERVIEW. As I post this, I am using the latest NomadBSD 131R, on a small Lenovo 300e. Everything works -- which says a lot for NomadBSD 131R. I have tried many systems which almost work, but not quite. DETAIL. NomadBSD 131R is based on FreeBSD. Being BSD, it is a little unfamiliar to me, but a short handbook tells me (almost) all I need to know. NomadBSD 131R looks beautiful, it works reliably, it offers persistence on USB, it is easily customizable, and it is obviously carefully thought out. It works something like Linux LXQt, although it includes a dock. Its various components are more tightly integrated than Linux.SOFTWARE. Being based on FreeBSD, NomadBSD 131R is well supplied with software. One might wish to keep to hand the FreeBSD Foundation's ""Installing Software on FreeBSD"" for basic instructions. Compared with Linux, installation of new packages is slow, however, and if NomadBSD 131R skips a beat (I am in Africa) one has to start all over again. FAULTS. NomadBSD 131R exhibits just a little buggish behavior. For instance, screen brightness sometimes jumps back to default, a package may refuse to install until one has a clean system, or an app may at first pop up as a mere icon. But these are small hitches, which are of no real consequence. ALL IN ALL. I was impressed with NomadBSD before. I had read that it worked beautifully for others -- but for my own system, it wasn't quite ready. Now it is ready. Review by Thomas O. Scarborough."
1068,2022-12-06, NomadBSD, 1.2,7,0,Now BSD has been made simple and effortless. The installation cannot be simplified any more than NomadBSD. Live mode with persistent is simply unexpected surprise.It works beautiful and all that. I am running NomadBSD onn on my 10 year old desktop pc with 4GB of DDR2 RAM. But Firefox browser does not allow me to open Google account and the Thunar file manager does not connect to main system hard drives and not even shown in the File manager. I doubt whether NomadBSD distro is secure to do online banking etc and I find no way to install Firewall on it. NomadBSD  required very little  efforts to install and automatic configuration did  the rest of installation.      
1069,2022-10-07, NomadBSD, 130r-20210508,8,1,"NomadBSD is a very attractive operating system that deserves to go a long way.It makes using FreeBSD more accessible & user friendly.The GUI is beautiful; one of the best interpretations of Openbox, ever. Where most Openbox-faced distros have multiple menus going all over the place, NomadBSD is very clean & tidy & usable.Even the website is neat and tidy.And the manual is precise & concise.The nearest Linux comparison is Slax; & it would not be unfair to say that NomadBSD is something of a BSD parallel to Slax, albeit that NomadBSD comes as a much more complete & equipped (& 6X bigger) distro, that is designed to be installed to hard drive.But that, alas, is where it ends.Mobile broadband is not something that works well on FreeBSD, & I was not willing to risk wrecking my Huawei E3372h modem on the off-chance that it may. With Slax, the workaround is simple: don't disconnect before rebooting; there is no damage limitation risk.On top of that, NomadBSD cannot read LUKS-encrypted drives, but that's another FreeBSD problem.Apart from these 2 contra-points NomadBSD is a great system, & I would make it my main distro if they were sorted upstream."

I recommend it to any one looking a solid and full of utilities to do all your daily work.I am able to do all my office work and my personal needs with this OS. I can play music, type my letters/memos and keep track of all my income and expenses with Libre Office. You should give it a try, you'll be glad you did."
1071,2022-07-01, NomadBSD, 130r-20210508,9,2,Just a fantastic OS with a friendly community. (forum.nomadbsd.org)It has good (as far as BSD's goes) hardware support and a nice out of the box experience assuming you like the Openbox experience.It has a nice and simple installer if you want to install it on your internal drive. It setup takes you through the process of encrypting the drive if you that is something you want. It also has a guided setup for using a Linux browser.If you want to try out a BSD experience this is a excellent choice.
1072,2022-03-11, NomadBSD, 1.4,8,4,"NomadBSD is designed to run as a persistent USB live distro. It ships with a compressed file nomadbsd.x.y.z.img.lzma which is decompressed, then the img file is burnt to a bootable USB. Upon its first run it asks about language, locale, keyboard, user(s), and then it reboots into GUI. It comes packaged with Firefox, Thunderbird, Thunar, LibreOffice, GIMP, Audacity etc. The GUI presents with a dock, and a menu on the top-left, or with a right-click anywhere on the screen. I tried it on a 10 years old laptop (Intel Core i3, 4GB RAM) from a USB and it worked smoothly with no issues. It detected the Wi-Fi, screen-resolution, and sound card. It comes with access to other software. The instructions on how to creat a bootable USB on the website are clear.It seems to be suitable as a nomad operating system, or a rescue operating system. It fares comparable to Knoppix in its capabilities as a live USB. The difference is that NomadBSD creates a partition on the USB where any changes are saved, so in w ay it is a proper nomad.   On another older notebook, it did not go well, as it did not recognise the hardware, which jumbled the USB, so I had to re-install it.Othewise, NomadBSD has a straight forward GUI based mini-installation process, comes bundled with a decent up-to-date software. I'd highly recommend it."
1073,2022-02-08, NomadBSD, 130r-20210508,9,2,"I have a specific need to run a persistent live system on one of my machines, and I tried a number of distros for this purpose. It is quite easy, of course, to make a persistent USB from any Debian or Ubuntu-based distro using Rufus, which can embed a persistence file in the iso.  Of these, Linux Mint works exceptionally well, like everything else about Mint.  Kali also works quite well, but I had difficulties with MX Linux and Slax.  Anyway, in the end, I decided to use NomadBSD and I have quite enjoyed the experience.  It is fast and stable, and the default Openbox desktop is great.  There is useful selection of default packages, which are all fairly current, and a wide range available in the repositories.  However, for someone with no Linux or BSD experience, Mint would still be a better option; my 80-year-old mom would have no problem using it once I booted it onto her machine for the first time.  NomadBSD still requires some tweaking that, while it's no problem for us, might frustrate a new Windows convert. Nevertheless, NomadBSD has 2 big advantages over Mint and the other Linux live USBs made with Rufus.  First, after allocating a certain amount of the USB for persistence for a Linux Distro, space on the device will inevitably be wasted.  As NomadBSD is entirely an img file, and thus all persistent, no space is wasted.  Also, on a Linux USB, the available space will decrease as one uses the internet, and will be recovered after the history is cleared.  This means that a USB with plenty of space can become filled if one ignores this,  and it can mess up the device when it is upgraded. On the img file of NomadBSD, no space is used up through internet use, same a normal computer hard drive.  I don't know the technical reason for this.  "

1078,2021-06-28, NomadBSD, 130r-20210508,10,23,"Honestly, I can't believe this is really FreeBSD.The Install: detected my fairly recent (2020) hardware and automatically provided drivers for the GPU, then booted up into a graphical install.  After a reboot, it put me into a GUI that was nice looking and easy to use for someone experienced with Linux.  No scary manual installation of Xorg that ends up failing, no struggling to install the correct driver and edit the correct .conf file.  If you have ever wanted to explore FreeBSD but couldn't manage to get hardware to work, this is definitely for you.  Daily Usage of about a week:  Full of features, fast, no crashing or other issues.  Lots of GUI settings to edit things.  However, I will say it still has some growing to do.  For example, there is a great feature that will allow you to install a Linux version of Chrome - but you can't log into a Google account because it's marked as insecure.Overall, I recommend giving it a try for those new to BSD systems or who don't want to spend time fighting FreeBSD to get it working well on a desktop.  This is essentially what Ubuntu was for Linux, and if it doesn't die off I bet it will gain some traction."

No problems accessing Windows drives / external media.Lots of useful software out of the box, and has the OctoPkg gui package manager which is similar to Synaptic.  The installed Firefox ESR updated to 78.7.1 & performs really well on my machines.Obviously there are limitations with BSD systems depending on your needs/hardware, but overall I’m loving Nomad as a brilliant simple to use alternative to Linux greats like Puppy, Easy and MX/Antix."

It will be snappy if installed on an SSD (I have it on a flashdrive using USB3, but my USB slots on the machine are getting to the point that sometimes they don't read that a drive was plugged in to it, or the transfer of files to and from are slower than molasses in January...I fear it's probably my MOBO, I *positive* it's not the NomadBSD).If the dev's can get this to finally see reiserfs systems, I'll be on this distro like white on rice!

Installed on my Walmart Gateway notebook and I'm pretty happy.Admittedly I was hesitant as I've been using Kubuntu for quite some time. But the direction Ubuntu is heading it's caused me to seek out an alternative. And after much searching, trial and error, I settled on Tuxedo.Once installed and after removing what I consider superfluous software, I go through the my usual Kubuntu setup (codecs, software install, settings, etc...)I wasn't sure how I'd feel using something based on 22.04 LTS but with KDE Plasma being up to date, relevant drivers, snaps nowhere to be seen, and Flathub up and ready to go, it's a very pain free experience. The only thing missing is a driver manager and minimum install option. I'm not a tinkerer nor a customization type. I just want something I can install, setup and not worry about there after. So far, Tuxedo delivers. "

I've installed a few programs using KDE Discover, which is MUCH faster than the Gnome software store I had used on the machine previously. I've done some minor tweaks to the theming, and it looks good and runs smoothly.I've had a couple minor updates, and one really major update which I ran through Discover with no issues.The Thinkpad has hybrid graphics, I've been using the Nvidia card for now since I'm plugged in to AC. No screen glitches. It's using X11.It's only been a week, but so far, I like it. Hope it hangs in there. I'm considering it for my desktop as well.Good job Dev's!"

The only thing I could recommend for the future is possibly a ""LITE"" variant? or an online installer which allows the user their choice of Desktop Environment?? Other than that anyone who gives this distro lower than a 9 is a either a dumbass or newbie suffering superficial butthurt or operator error. I have suffered zero problems when installation is done by-the-book. Now I have had problems with ventoy installs , so I wouldnt suggest anything other than a straight 1:1 image to disk. "
1097,2023-05-02, TUXEDO OS, 2-20230427,9,4,"I am running this system on a TUXEDO Pulse 15 Gen 1, therefore I cannot say anything about the performance (it's a quite powerful laptop).The installation is a no-brainer if you use the fully automated ""WebFAI"" installer. You can create a WebFAI USB stick with a creator software downloadable from the Tuxedo website. It's very simple to use but does not handle errors well (it just starts from the beginning without any explanation), so I ended up downloading the WebFAI ISO and flashing it to my USB drive myself.I called WebFAI a no-brainer because all you get to choose your Linux flavor and if you want your disk encrypted or not. All the rest, the disk layout and the preinstalled software, is pre-defined. The WebFAI installer apparently does not use an image file but instead downloads each package separately, so the system is up-to-date from the first boot.The system itself is basically a Tuxedo-branded Ubuntu. It features a modern KDE desktop with the Tuxedo X on the application menu button, the Tuxedo Control Center and the WebFAI creator. The preinstalled software is so complete that I had to install very little software on my own – in fact, I only installed fish and KMail myself. Even git is already on board. The predefined color scheme is white-orange and dark-orange respectively, however there is no Tuxedo-branded dark wallpaper that really fits the dark one. Kate makes up for that, it presents itself in a yellowish, eye-friendly look.All in all this is a bold move from TUXEDO OS 1 as it feels way more well-rounded. I recommend it to those who run the first TUXEDO OS and/or want a carefree system without snap'd Firefox."
1098,2023-04-27, TUXEDO OS, 2-20230417,10,9,"Fantastic version of KDE Plasma. Nice stable Ubuntu 22.04 LTS base with newest Plasma desktop and Flatpaks enabled by default. For those that don't like Snaps - they are not installed by default.I used this on both my Acer/Intel laptop and HP/Intel desktop and it worked great on both machines. I think the updates are somewhat numerous or large. Possibly because it has a newer version of Plasma. I still prefer Linux Mint but KDE Plasma is growing on me thanks to Tuxedo OS. It made me look at Kubuntu again and I am liking both versions of KDE.The kernel is relatively new in the 6 series.This is like the Mint version of KDE. Latest Ubuntu LTS with Flatpaks and no snaps. I think this is the best version of KDE Plasma next to Kubuntu. It has an upgrade path with all the latest software, kernel, and Plasma desktop.Best part is that it is fast and stable without the need to spend countless hours customizing an Arch distribution."

Totally unwatchable if you can get it to play at all.Works find under Win10, Debian, Mint..Distro takes too much set-up effort, would never recommend it.Tried it mainly because I haven't looked at KDE for a while.Can't hold a candle to Mate.I run a small home network with multiple machines/distros and never had this much trouble."

They seem to have tweaked this to make it faster on both VM and hardware than any other KDE Plasma distro I am accustomed to using, including MX and Kubuntu.I was also pleasantly surprised that it saved my ""live"" changes to the installation, much like MX and Mageia both do.So far, I can't really find any cons; I haven't experienced any issues after updating, as some reviews have indicated. But then, I do all updates in all distros via cli terminal, rather than GUI options. Maybe that makes a difference, maybe not. To me it's faster and less problematic."

It works ok until you start going for the SLIGHTEST  update then the video driver no longer works and if you persist updating the software especially if you have a Nvidia video card which is what Tuxedo ships its computers then you will boot into a blacks screen. The problem with Tuxedo computers is that you CANNOT install other linux because Tuxedo provides unique drivers for the keyboard and the processor. IF it worked properly Tuxedo would be a nice OS the only way to make it work is to disable ALL UPDATES and manually install some components like Firefox, SMplayer etc. It would be nice if it worked but it does not such has been my experience using it for a two years and the computer costs $ 3000."

1107,2023-01-29, TUXEDO OS, 1-20220929,10,4,"Several vendors have gone down the commercial path as in either a custom OS or charging to support a re-branded version such as PC/OpenSystems with varying degrees of success. Probably the worst example is Linuxfx but folks will always be vulnerable to slick advertising especially when the promises made are not subject to regulatory scrutiny like if you buy a car or a kettle. TUXEDO OS on the other hand takes this to another level by providing a custom system that really does offer something extra and not just different. Some users easily become obsessed with speed and resource use since a few micro seconds saved opening Dolphin or Firefox count for little in the real world but if this is your thing then TUXEDO is faster than its base distro and will use less resources to do the same things. The build quality is first class and the customizations have been carefully thought out to provide purpose rather than just add numbers to a features list. Makes the myriad of Arch based systems so many people install and then regret look like toys in the wind. IMO for some time the Russians had a slight edge with systems such as ALT, ROSA and Calculate but the recent releases have been a step backwards. Germany on the other had has always been the most solid source with the likes of Q4OS, Neptune, Siduction, Netrunner and Kanotix although the latter seems to be struggling to maintain development. Now we have TUXEDO and a worthy contender for the ‘best of’ in terms of what they promise and also deliver. "

1127,2022-09-15, Rocky Linux, 9.0,1,0,"Not impressed, still get mcelog errors on AMD processors which have been occurring since 2014ish. It’s funny searching the official redhat bug sites that their recommendation is to just ignore the error that it does not work on AMD, another redhatter suggested this was a cosmetic error and no correction needed. Someone else suggested mcelog was deprecated and to use rasdaemon instead, if it is deprecated why are you still shipping it in ver 9? So they have been kicking the can down the road for 9 years and nobody has bothered to look at it. It does work on SUSE/openSUSE who have their own patched ver and are much better at fixing bugs than closing them out hoping they will fix themselves like they do at redhat. So I guess the advantage of going with Rocky is that you get free bugs for free that redhat doesn’t know how to fix and cheaper than paying the $179 redhat is asking."

I waited on going to any EL8 distro when the news came out about CentOS and I stuck around on Scientific Linux 7 (for which I still have such love for) but I've been very impressed with how solid and stable Rocky 9 has been. When I've had issues their community was quick to help and very friendly. Running Rocky 9 now on everything from big servers in the server room to my home lab of Intel NUCs and Raspberry Pi's.Keep up the great work Rocky!

Anyway, the transfer tool worked well, the OS has been very stable and I’ve experienced no crashes and no lock-ups. It runs better and faster than CentOS did. If you want a free community-based enterprise distro, I’d recommend Rocky.

Initially pessimistic about such scripts in general (most fail on edge-cases), I was surprised how well it is working. Nice! Thanks for this effort to the Rocky Linux developers for this great job! You made my life a lot easier!For about four weeks the entire infrastructure that ran CentOS before is on Rocky Linux. Even some of the more difficult CentOS 7 machines were -successfully without exception- migrated to Rocky 8.5 (for this major version migration there are many descriptions on the web to provide additional guidance).Among other applications, I run Apache, NginX, Pacemaker/Corosync, keepalived, LVS, FreeIPA idM, MariaDB, Icinga, Moodle, KVM and SOLR. I do not a single crash to report: everything runs in a very solid manner.Rocky Linux is a server distribution, so I personally do not care much for GUIs.

I love Peppermint and use 5-22-2022, but recently tried the 2023-07-01 distro. Big Trouble on my HP570 and Lenovo laptop (same issues):1 - Grub refuses to see ANY other OS on your drive, Windoze or Linux, after installing and choosing Replace a Partition. 2 - Windscribe-CLI cannot be made to work. The same installer works on older Peppermint and every other OS I have.3 - Windscribe's GUI app will not run.This distro is faster at booting and feels even more crisp than the previous version, but problem 1 is too annoying and the lack of Windscribe is a distro killer for me.

Luckily if you hold down FN and tap F6 twice then it turns it off and then in the setting set numlock not to restore state6) Tap to click not enabled by default.

This new version, dated 2023-07-01, is a definite improvement though there are some changes that require some getting used to.It installed smoothly and definitely faster than the previous incarnation, loading in roughly half the time and not stalling along the way. It booted up faster too which is an accomplishment.The updater is much improved and actually gives better feedback on what it’s doing.The Hub is approximately the same, though I have not found the repository for additional backgrounds and themes yet.Most of the changes that I have seen are with xfce, not the underlying system. It’s polished a little differently and finding some things is a bit of a treasure hunt. Usability isn’t appreciably different, though.This is a very definite positive step forward for Peppermint.

My current 'daily driver' desktop is still running flawlessly on Peppermint 9 (2019). I've patiently been waiting for a Debian-based version of Peppermint OS for years, and its time is finally here. The current 2023-07-01 (2023) version is marketed as a ""minimalistic distribution"". Don't let that scare you away. They've got you covered! 2023-07-01 is a joy to install and use, like all previous versions of Peppermint OS. No ugly surprises here. As Goldilocks would say, it's not too big and not too small. It's just right! It uses the 'tried and true' Xfce 4.18 desktop environment. Once again, not too big, not too small, just right. Peppermint OS has always demanded fewer hardware resources, from Peppermint 1 (2011) to '2023-07-01' (2023), thus it's an excellent choice for older machines. Matter of fact, '2023-07-01' is running beautifully on my antique Intel Core 2 laptop with 3 GB RAM and room to spare. Fear not! Peppermint has kept its minimalist spirit.

It does not disappoint you and it is dare I say even faster than Ubuntu or Linux Mint ever will be! I cannot vouche for this system enough! It saved an early 2011 Acer E5132 laptop from going kaput. As for a con, the only con I can think of is there is not an easier way to install a different desktop environment (DDE). I had to use the debian ""Sudo-tasksel"" to install cinnamon on my laptop. It should be easier to do so, but I digress. Keep up the great  work @PeppermintOS!"

1169,2023-05-24, Peppermint OS, 5-22-2022,8,3,"I ran Peppermint 10 on a relatively modern system and I had no real troubles with it. I loaded up the newest version recently and I struggled through the installation and configuration but I ultimately ended up with a decently configured, responsive and reliable system. There were some gotchas along the way.Installation was smooth at first. I managed to get the OS installed and the first time it booted up it was fine. However, subsequent boots failed. The symptoms suggested a hardware failure relating to graphics, but this proved not to be the case. Instead, udev apparently got very confused and wrote the grub bootloader to the wrong drive, so the hard drive had no boot loader once the USB media was ejected.I discovered the boot loader issue when I tried to install updates and the system hung. I couldn't install anything at all, and using the graphical software installer finally revealed an issue requiring manual intervention. Once I did that, it downloaded and applied all the updates and everything worked fine and the system has been very reliable ever since. The need to get grub straight apparently blocked everything else, waiting for user input without ever asking for it.All that is to say, there's something wrong with the installer. It's not a deal breaker and I assume I am an isolated case, but it was highly frustrating until I figured out what was happening. On the plus side, there was a path to getting the issue straight without having to reload or just give up.Once installed and once the grub issue was resolved, the system has been very responsive and very light on resources. I have been able to install new packages, use external devices, connect to my network and use this system as a general computing device as well as a developer workstation. It's different than the old version of Peppermint, but it works well for my purposes and I am pleased with it.The latest Peppermint is a decent system. However, be aware that the installation can subtly fail and cause issues that are not immediately clear."

I haven't experienced any crashes or freezing since I started using it, which is a huge improvement from my previous operating system. It also runs smoothly even when I have multiple programs and windows open.Another standout feature is the vast selection of built-in apps and tools. From productivity apps like a word processor and spreadsheet program to entertainment options like a media player and game store, there's something for everyone.Overall, I highly recommend this operating system to anyone in the market for a new one.

1173,2022-12-19, Peppermint OS, 5-22-2022,10,2,"This review is for Peppermint Devuan edition 2022.  I really liked version 10 a few years ago and kept watching developments. The Devuan edition is installed on two of my systems and is running essentially perfectly. I did notice that some of the package options I checked during install went missing but it was easy enough to add them in later. I don't really have dog in the fight over SystemD other than to say that after 250 some revisions they still don't think they have it right and that tells me it is an uncontrollable monster something like Windows. Simpler is almost always better and this version of Peppermint seems to run very fast and efficiently. I am always searching for a distro to make use of my older laptops and this one fills the bill better than most any I have tried. It finds all the hardware in both my B450 Ryzen 5600G system and in my 15 year old HP Core 2 Quad laptop. I did have to add a boot switch (init_on_alloc=0) to that old machine to get the sleep / resume functionality to work but that has been true for all the distros I have tried that are on the 5.x kernel. I like that I could get the wake-on-lan functionality to work using only the gui network configurations rather that poking around in configuration files. That seems to be a plus for XFCE systems.The lack of a browser in the live version is a bit annoying but it is easy enough to add in after installation. I had to use Firefox initially just to get the Vivaldi browser installed since it wasn't one of the choices. I would have then deleted Firefox but it turns out the CPU load when watching full screen Youtube videos is lower in Firefox than in Vivaldi so I will keep it for that.If simplicity, speed, and efficiency are your priorities then Peppermint Devuan might be a good choice."
1174,2022-11-14, Peppermint OS, 5-22-2022,3,5,"Tried Peppermint with the MATE desktop. MATE installed OK. Peppermint is a stripped down version of Debian. Very inflexible in terms of having at least a minimum number of needed packages installed. So you have to pick and choose what you want; even the most basic packages. This can be good for those who want to have more control over their workspace, but not for those who want to install it and be up and running in a minimum amount of time. One deal breaker is that you actually have to search on the web on how to do updates, and then go through the process of installing Peppermint's Update Manager yourself. Then when you initiate the Update Manager, it just plows through full steam and doesn't even let you see or choose what updates you want to install. Why didn't they just include the Update Manager already installed with the distro? This is very bad programming on the part of the developers! There are far better distros out there based on Debian such as MX Linux with its great assortment of tools and LMDE 5, based on Debian and developed by the Linux Mint team. I will pass on Peppermint.  "
1175,2022-11-07, Peppermint OS, 5-22-2022,4,5,"(November 06, 2022 Release)(See previous review from 2022-11-05)I really wanted to like this distro...They addressed the uefi install issues, but the o/s it totally unusable for myself due to gpu glitches present in some older software...I have a semi-modern gpu AMD Navi 22 and these are usually issues I can correct by updating from Chimaera to Daedalus or Ceres, but since changing that in this os in the /etc/apt/sources.list does nothing at all it's keeping me on older mesa versions that keeps the persistent graphical glitches. This o/s has a repo called ""peppermint"" and it's put together like a ""Frankenstein"" o/s, and I would not recommend this to anyone that has a computer with components made in the last 2 years. The o/s did actually run fine, but my inability to choose the line of packages (from Devuan releases daedalus/ceres/etc) just kept bugs present that will not work for my purposes. I will attempt to try this again in Jan 2023 at the earliest, as I am looking for an O/S environment  to recommend, (systemd free & Devuan based) geared towards non-technical people with some tools for the update/upgrade.As it stands, currently you just can't beat the base Devuan install and add what you need yourself via either synaptic or apt."
1176,2022-11-05, Peppermint OS, 5-22-2022,6,0,"For starters, the loss of 4 points: I downloaded the Devuan edition (I'm still going to blame the Calamares installer for the mostpart) and grub failed to install on the same system I've installed the original Devuan on successfully. Using only 3 partitions as I have with the version that this Pepperment was based on, Devuan alone installed just fine using only /boot/efi , / , /home on the main nvme drive. The automatic option wanted to pull a ""1st time user's method, and dump both the / and /home on the same partition with just a boot partition... No thanks on that one. The installer for ""automated install"" didn't even offer a checkbox for ""Separate /home partition"". After Calamares failed the 4th time trying, I decided to just use the original Devuan netinstall for the new  system and make my own update script. I feel that an isolated /home is essential and should always be used. The live environment: At 1.3 GB download, and it's already exceeded the size of a burnable CD and plenty of space left if you chose to burn a DVD and completely irrelevant if you chose to dd the iso to a usb stick, the live environment (as others have mentioned) did not include a web browser at all. I know I could have installed one in the live environment, but Pepperment user (This distro seems geared towards the inexperienced user), may not know that they can just update apt and install a browser to use for the live session.The live environment worked fine and seemed stable, but the fact that a 1.3GB iso didn't have a usable browser out-of-the-box leaves me to classify this as ""A work in progress"". The forums for the grub issues (have been going on for too long in my opinion) go back for months with ""dirty"" solutions to the problem.In it's current state, I would not recommend this distro for an inexperienced Linux user, but it shows promise and I intend to check back every so often as I'm looking to reduce my load and find an O/S for the people I technically support to use everyday with some more ""automatic"" solutions for updating/upgrading their systems but without using systemd. "
1177,2022-10-29, Peppermint OS, 10,10,0,"After a long time I installed Peppermint OS again. Now based on Debian. I used to have MX Linux on the machine, but I read it was full of bloatware. I am very satisfied with Peppermint OS. Fast, accurate, lightweight. What can be improved: I would add a browser to the live system. However, other programs are not lacking. Everyone expands the system with what they want.   It makes your life easier with Peppermint if you don't mind using the Terminal. I installed the missing programs with the apt command (sudo apt-get install vlc, gthumb, gimp, htop, etc.), but there is also a Synaptic package manager in the system.   By switching to Debian, the lightness of the distribution was preserved. It works smoothly with daily tasks on my eight-year-old laptop (i7-4600U. 2 cores, 4 virtual threads + 8GB RAM). (Office software, browsing, web editing, GIMP, youtube, etc.).   Thanks to the team and all those contributing to this wonderful project."
1178,2022-09-16, Peppermint OS, 5-22-2022,9,4,"It takes little resources, is quick, helpful links and nice themes give it a good look and feel  It worked on my 8 year HP laptop without having to futz with any drivers.  I see complaints (cons) that it doesn't come with much pre-installed, but I think that was the point... give users the choice up front on as much as possible to install so you don't have to go back and remove unwanted web browsers or media players.  The greeting screen makes it easy, but it might keep it from being the choice for first time linux users.In my months of usage as my travel work station and substitute home computer (image, doc editing, MS Teams, Zoom Calls, web browsing) it was very reliable and enjoyable to use.  I'd recommend it to anybody wanting a light weight install who has a little familiarity with linux."
1179,2022-08-24, Peppermint OS, 5-22-2022,10,12,"Ive been waiting a long time to get such a great lightweight distro based on Debian. The ability to be able to install only the apps I want beforehand is a big selling point. The speed and low resource usage, combined with all the little features such as the welcome screen,pephub and updater really make this a must have. For those who dont want snap or flatpak its a godsend as its tough to find distros that give you this much freedom. It works equally well on my 14 year old laptop versus my recent desktop. The switching to Calamares as the installer was a great move and overall its a loot easier to use for both novices and advanced users. All devices were detected without issue and during the live session, my settings and wifi were carried over to the install without issue. The extra themes,icons and wallpapers really make this OS look great. Ive had no issues whatsoever while using it and now have it installed on foru of my laptops. Its one of the fastest distros to install Ive ever used.Obviously not having a default browser can be issue for some but for the majority of users, the install is a great experience. Those who have commented that some apps werne t default miss the point to Peppermint. Having a minimal install is what many want, and most users prefer to add apps they prefer, not forced to pull things out and chance disturbing the install.Definitely recommend this distro to anyone, particularly to those with older hardware or who need a 32bit version. The semi-rolling aspect of it I also find a great idea and Debian's release schedule is very moderate. I praise the devs for creating such a remarkable distro that is so flexible, fast and attractive."
1180,2022-08-15, Peppermint OS, 5-22-2022,10,3,"I am pleased that my Peppermint_2022 now has the Mintstick USB writerand formatter, but I don't remember if these were shipped in the distroor if I installed them from the ""deb"" file.

Version 010 was based on Bionic, so it was time for a newrelease and the developers came through.This is one of the distrosthat keeps me interested in Linux and I am a distro hopper.

1181,2022-08-11, Peppermint OS, 5-22-2022,9,0,"TL;DR Peppermint 10 Respin good, Peppermint 11 meh, Devuan-based Peppermint intriguingPeppermint has been my WFH OS since I installed Peppermint 10 Respin in March, 2020. I suddenly needed a fast-booting, intuitive OS to run dual-monitor remote desktop sessions and Zoom conferences. Peppermint boots miraculously fast and performs beautifully on my quad-core, 8GB RAM, 120GB SSD, surplus thin client. Although Peppermint runs acceptably well on my similarly-spec'd dual-core laptop (I'm using it to write this review), I don't recommend dual-core hardware for videoconferencing.Peppermint has a look-and-feel that PC users will find familiar. I switched my PC to Peppermint one evening, and was online and productive the next morning. The familiar look-and-feel makes it less jarring to task-switch between local Linux and remote PC sessions. I especially appreciate having 101-key keyboard support, since I make constant use of Ctrl/Shift/Alt/Win key combinations in my work.Peppermint OS 11 diverges from earlier versions. It does retain the PC-user friendly look-and-feel, and it's now based on Debian LTS which has a more stately update cadence than Lubuntu LTS. But a lot of the bundled apps that made Peppermint 10 Respin so easy to adopt are absent from version 11: no browser, no media player, no calculator, and no cloud app links in the Office menu.First-time Linux users are probably better-served installing Peppermint 10 Respin, at least until the development team fleshes out a similar app bundle for the new Debian-based release.More seasoned Linux users might be interested in the new Devuan-based Peppermint OS edition that's emerging even as I write this.Pros:- Boots miraculously fast from SSD (under 30sec)- Performs well on modest hardware like a quad-core, 8GB RAM, 120GB SSD, surplus HP t620- Familiar look-and-feel for first-time Linux users- Desktop similarity between local PeppermintOS and remote PC sessions- Keyboard symmetry between local PeppermintOS and remote PC sessions (Ctrl/Alt/Shift/Win key combinations)- Broad peripheral support: Graphics, Webcams, Audio, Printers, Bluetooth, USB- Commonly available remote work apps: Zoom, Citrix, Windows RDP (Remmina)- Commonly available everyday apps: Firefox, Chrome, Spotify, Pithos (Pandora)- Based on Debian LTS which is more mature and stable than Lubuntu LTS- Emerging Devuan-based Peppermint OS edition may appeal to technical users wanting a systemd-free OSCons:- PeppermintOS 11 omits a lot of common apps that were bundled in Peppermint 10 Respin- No default calculator- No default web browser- No default media players (Parole? VLC?)- No default Office360 ICE (browser app) links"

I compared all of them in terms of speed, stability, features and smoothness, and I also installed Windows software, which of course was not installed in many of them or had problems. It ate, but everything was good in peppermint. and above all, everything was good only in two of the Linuxes. The first choice was Peppermint and the second choice was MX.---In my opinion, it has been treated less kindly and it should be seen more. I recommend you to test it"

I usually break my system after installing a new distro while installing software and messing with settings.I also had no problems picking up wifi ootb, usuall have to mess with that to get my wifi adaptor to connect. The only drawback I would mention is the lack of some software not being available for debian, but that's a debian problem, not Peppermint. "
1184,2022-06-28, Peppermint OS, 10,10,6,"I have been using Peppermint OS for over two months now, and for me it has been the most stable, light weight distro I have used for a long time. The developers have put a lot of effort into the small details, to make the Debian base and XFCE DE work smoothly together.From first installing to SSD, I had the choice of which file format I wanted to use. After installing the OS, on first boot, you get the Welcome to Peppermint page that lets you add software, including browsers, office, media etc. The team have included Peppermint Hub, this has all the shortcuts you need to add extra software, hardware drivers, printers or tweak the desktop.For me, I have found that Peppermint OS has the right combination of a stable system without any of the bloat or software that I am never going to use, but with the choice to add what I want to make it more personalised for me. Thank you to the Peppermint OS Team and all the developers that have put in the time and effort to make this an excellent Linux distro!"

I entered my dongle's address into the SSB, and it was not found, because there is no web-browser to launch: genius.There seems to be a them running in some current Linuxen that no-one uses mobile broadband. Some have browsers that are not capable of connecting to dongle addresses, which is bad enough; but now, PeppermintOS does not even have a browser of any useable kind installed.This takes the biscuit!Are developers trying to turn people away from Linux?This is a serious issue, given that many people depend upon mobile broadband for their internet connection.Oh, once bright one, how hast thou fallen!"

So fast and customizable! I am having lots of fun with this on my old ASUS laptop. I have found zero issues with it in 24 hours of constant playing! This was not the case with MXLinux, although I liked it for the most part. The ability on Peppermint to chose virtually every piece of software from the Calamares getgo is awesome. The minimalist approach really speeds things up on my old, but very useful hardware. My highest regards to the developers and I am so glad Peppermint is back!"

I'm hoping they will have an Ubuntu-based LTS release coming. Meanwhile I won't shy from using the2022 release. I have it on my current configuration where I use four hard drives to house my array of Linux distros.I use a DellOptiplex 9020 with a quad core Intel Core i5-4590 processor and 16 GB of RAM. I have never seriously thought of replacing a Peppermint OS, UEFI, I must say, has made it more difficult to be a  distro hopper but my motto is to do the best I can and have a functioning PC. This one is a refurbed model showing no signs of decline, but in my experience the death of a computer comes suddenly, without warning. I would recommend Peppermint 2022 for a Windows user who wants to test Linux but caution himor her to be sure to have a way to restore Windows unless committed to using Linux only. Time and experience have steered me in the direction of Linux-only usage, because I count on being able to install a Linux OS in the event I find myself needing one.

1189,2022-05-03, Peppermint OS, 2022-02-02,2,1,"Peppermint went from being my favorite distro to being one that won't run properly any any way.  I ditched it about a week after the new version came out.  It simply does not work well at all.  It is nothing but constant freezing - constant restarting and forget trying to play any video files - best of luck with that.  It is extremely difficult to install.  It requires manual partitioning which is not easy to do.  If you just click install using the entire disk, you will have even more problems than I did with manual partitioning.  I tried both.  I have no idea of what has happened to this distro but hope the next version will work as I would gladly return to it.  I liked it because of its speed.  It is the fastest distro I have ever used.

I don't install things here if I cannot at least access synaptic, so Peppermint is a hard pass for me..   the lack of basic software such as a browser, office, mail & media player is making it difficult to test ( and this ""needing 500 characters for this review thing is a ""WTF"" )     let's at least offer some kind of browser maybe?  it is so easy to remove it if you don't like that browser, (well unless it is Firefox and you have Libre Office linked to it :P)"
1191,2022-04-25, Peppermint OS, 2022-02-02,9,0,"At home I run the KDE version of MX Linux but I have been using Peppermint as my daily driver on a work laptop for about two weeks and I have to say it's great to see the devs back in the saddle again. From the trouble free install on both Virtualbox and bare metal, excellent hardware detection of my brand spanking new HP 17-ck0013na laptop and the initial helpful setup prior to use, I'm very impressed with the transition from a Lubuntu base to Debian and pure XFCE desktop.Jesse Smith gives imo has given fair review of this distro, I find myself in almost total agreement. If I was to nitpick (you knew I would) I'd only comment about Jesse's assessment regarding the lack of an installed browser. As to which browser users decide to go with based on their own criteria ranging from how accustomed they are to one browser over another, right down to the fact they can or cannot add their fav cat or dog theme is always going to be a minefield. Pre-install Firefox and a few think it should never see the light of day because bla bla.. go with Chromium and before you know it someone who's preference for Pale Moon (really?!!) feels somehow driven to condemn the whole distro as ill conceived. So having the choice offered from the get-go seems good idea. As for the implication of an additional download for the unfortunate on slow connections to get a browser, well to be fair they've just downloaded a 1.6GB ISO installer so I don't see how downloading a tiny fraction of that to get their browser of choice is really going to matter. Like I said, if I was to nitpick :)For newcomers in particualr to Linux, and on up to the experienced, Peppermint (like MX Linux) has a lively user forum to turn to if needed, a final product that's tested thoroughly before release and as Jesse mentioned a turn of speed yet light on resources that's imo as good as anything out there right now."

After a little hesitation, I decided to take this step, and I do not regret it at all. The installation was quick and clean, the system is nimble on my machine, the new design is pleasant. Thank you to the Peppermint OS team for a great job."
1209,2022-02-04, Peppermint OS, 2022-02-02,9,0,"I haven't as yet done a full test of this ""new"" Peppermint. On first glance it seems to be just as good as the ""old"" Peppermint.Happy that they`ve gone away from the Ubuntu base and gone with Debian. So far as a Peppermint user for quite a few years, I am pleasantly pleased with the direction that the developers are taking. Considering they are doing it on a part time basis, I have the utmost respect for their hard work and dedication.I am so glad that Peppermint has not gone to the graveyard and is looking forward to the future.Well done people.

After reading some of the review here, I wondered if installing Redcore was going to be a waist of my time. Redcore has been around for ages, but I was reluctant to try it. I gave it a shot after testing a string of terrible distros that were highly recommended. I loaded Redcore into my 2015, slow as molasses Gateway, and it came alive! Thanks to Redcore it's fast as lightening now, and is on my desk and no longer in the trash heap. I had always liked Gentoo distros but most have vanished over the years. Sabayon was a favorite, but its complicated updating progress usually led to software conflicts resulting in a meltdown. Redcore is simple, straightforward, and practical. But with Linux flexibility. That's what I like. I think more people would like it too, if they just gave it a try."
1211,2023-03-08, Redcore Linux, 2301,10,46,"Redcore Linux was installed Feb. 25, 2023 onto my 2008 Dell Studio i-7 with eight gigs of memory.  Redcore requires a lot more time to install binary applications than I have experienced with any other operating systems, but every application works perfectly.  Applications run smoother and more responsive than I have experienced with any other Linux system.  In addition to binary and source applications, I have installed third-party applications such as Google-Chrome without a glitch.  Either Twitter and Facebook changes their system to be smoother operating, or Redcore did something to make those two sites run smoother.  "
1212,2023-02-25, Redcore Linux, 2301,10,36,"Interesting distribution as there are not many Gentoo based distributions around. Last time I checked, Sabayon was dead and reincarnated in something weird called MoccacinoOS without any Gentoo resemblance. This one works extremely well on my hardware, which is a gaming Asus GL702ZC laptop, wifi, sound, bluetooth, touchpad, everything seem to work correctly. Is fast as well, and with Lutris and Steam preinstalled, is a great fit to my laptop. Will keep it around for a while, to see if an update breaks it, but so far, I like what I see and how it feels on my hardware. Time will tell if it will remain stable."
1213,2023-02-25, Redcore Linux, 2201,9,17,"Used this operating system on think-pad still installed, accidentally got the notorious black screen of death, after used my smart-phone did some research online seems to be something to do with boot manager using light-dm and sddm. Went to redcore home page saw they had the fix, used it, it says after you fix light-dm and sddm to update the operating system. Had similar problems using Slackware 15 and their respins and forks such as zenwalk. If' redcore team in Romanian could iron out ( fix this bug error ) this bug on future."
1214,2023-02-24, Redcore Linux, 2301,4,0,"I have followed this distro since its ""orion"" version and I have been installing it on different computers: it does not work well on any. Sometimes it doesn't recognize the touchpad, sometimes it doesn't recognize the wifi, sometimes the graphics card doesn't work well with xorg or wayland, when other distros work perfectly on the computer. In short: I have installed the distro in different versions and on about 5 different computers: none of it works completely well. Otherwise, it's a good idea to make Gentoo simpler. I know ""purists"" want ""pure"" Linux. I only want Linux to work, not to waste time with the PC."
1215,2023-01-11, Redcore Linux, 2201,7,2,"The ISO is over 4GB and three months old. I strongly recommend, to those who have slow Internet connections, and to those not familiar with Gentoo to pass this by until the developers put out a new ISO. If the Sisyphus program is interrupted for any reason trying to do a system update, and it's run again, it clears all packages it previously downloaded. It's so very frustrating, it was trying to get at least 3GB of stuff which took me nearly six hours. In the last 1-1/2 hours it obtained no more than 50 packages. With 50 more packages to get it suddenly crashed. Then when I went to run Sisyphus again it made like starting from the beginning.Cannot use Discover instead because it's buggy and this is with any distro that features KDE.It's understandable the team is small and are doing what they can. But one would have liked to keep this distro, with the ""effects"" of Calculate being able to provide a weekly ISO.I'm not a great fan of KDE Plasma but the ""bloody red"" theme on this distro looks spectacular. I went further tweaking it because it seems the compositor was disabled and therefore window backgrounds could blend into each other.Will need at least 32GB _on_ _the_ _main_ _partition_ in case of the folly I have just suffered.by mnrv-ovrf-year-c"
1216,2022-11-14, Redcore Linux, 2201,8,5,"I have been a Redcore user for 4 years and I confirm that the distribution has made great progress, especially for installation.By running a new installation of recent version 2201, I was confronted with a Calamares error: using another file system than ext4 the installation of the bootloader crashes (I had the same problem on other distributions this it is therefore not Redcore which is in question).Another small black point that I can criticize is the lack of distribution-specific documentation. Ok, we can rely on the Gentoo documentation but a slightly developed Redcore wiki would not be a luxury.Finally I can point out that Wayland and KDE still don't mix well, especially with an NVidia graphics card :-)"
1217,2022-10-09, Redcore Linux, 2201,6,1,"It is a pity that does not have support for other languages, the world is not reduced to English speech.They seem to be reduced to this field, which reduces the possibilities that more people can use Redcore.With that change they made, and safely, the number of users would increase greatly.In favor it has the incomparable base of Gentoo, pre -compilation, desktop entens, facility ease, etc.All that good job is limited by the use of a single language.For the rest, very few distributions have the versatility of Redcore."
1218,2022-10-07, Redcore Linux, 2201,5,0,"Gave it a rating 5 based on its usefulness to me. I did not bother installing Redcore as it would be no use to me personally, as I need RTSP streaming, so I am not saying Redcore is not a fine effort, it just no good to me.I have only written this because in the past I have used Linux distro's and VLC as an Onvif security camera server option, however this time around, I am surprised how many distros, do not support RTSP streaming anymore.Forget anything Debian and derivatives or Gentoo as well, it appears, I will now try Manjaro. "
1219,2022-10-06, Redcore Linux, 2201,7,1,"I think the idea behind this distro is great: make gentoo very usable. It comes with many packages already precompiled and easy to install using Sisyphus. It is also easy to update packages and system. Among the precompiled packages, there is skype, google chrome, wine, etc. However, it hasn't worked on my new hardware: installer gives problems, distro too: almost nothing works on kde plasma (lenovo new intel i5); in another almost new and simple laptop it does not pick up the wifi either (hp with amd athon). On old imac doesn't recognize my wifi. It's a shame, because I really want to have this distro and use it as a daily controller, i love gentoo when gentoo is more easier. "
1220,2022-10-06, Redcore Linux, 2201,1,0,"I had heard of this distro and wanted to give it a try as I am a fan of Gentoo but did not want to go through another 2-3 days of compiling everything like I did on another box. Thats the only reason I cant take Gentoo seriously, its not something you can install quickly restore and get back to work, plus trying to get full disk encryption is another story. But anyway I downloaded the iso and booted it up in a qemu vm got a red boot screen and selected the top option ""start redcore"" and it started up and went to a cli, ok so I saw that root login was just enter with no password so now I am at a root prompt, I was under the impression this was a graphical install but let me go to the documentation and verify where to go from here as I am familiar with Gentoo. I go to the install page and these were the instructions:""There is currently no text in this page. You can search for this page title in other pages, or search the related logs, but you do not have permission to create this page.""   So I looked around and other links showed the same message so I thought let me try it one more time in case it was a fluke. I got the same result. Not sure what to think of this distro but I will tell you I am also testing out Calculate which is a binary Gentoo based distro and it is by far the best out there, it just works and they have done a fantastic job plus they do have documentation to get you up and running unlike Redcore so my advice is dont waste your time with this and go straight to Calculate."
1221,2022-08-21, Redcore Linux, 2102,10,6,"usually nothing gets a 10.  I've tried and retried this distro and come away impressed.  Either the speed or the stability wasn't there of something simple just didn't work, or it took too long to update or it took too long to build a package.  Now it's slicker and quicker and the most stable distro I've ever felt (I mean it, you can literally feel how stable it is)  It does what Debian won't and gives you the flexibility of Gentoo.  I've replaced three machines Arch based distro with this because it looks better that the best arch based plasma.  When I was last here I said that it would work on one of my laptops the lenovo t540' with i5 chip and not the t540 with the i7 chip.  That problem seems to have been fixed.  It takes a little while to update but when its over it's well worth it.  This is now my daily driver."
1222,2022-05-05, Redcore Linux, 2102,8,5,Thought I'd revisit this distro and am pleasantly surprised.  No problem with install.  It's gorgeous as usual but this time things actually work and its not as slow as molasses.  You can feel the stability of the distro as you use it and it doesn't take a year to compile a program any more.  Sisyphus has improved this distro drastically.  I do believe I might be able to find a permanent home for this one.  There are still a few programs that  I would like to see in the package manager but I've got time.  I actually like this version and will keep it around for a while.

Highly suggested. Redcore Linux is here to stay and grow in popularity."
1229,2021-06-14, Redcore Linux, 2101,4,1,"I have always wanted to love Redcore, but it looks like that Redcore does not love my hardware :). I have long been trying to get it work, since 1908 version, attracted by the developer's praiseworthy goal: ""bringing the power of Gentoo to the masses"". Indeed, the distro offers a graphical software manager (sisyphus) and binary packages, saving you hours of compiling (that should be the standard Gentoo way) and, importantly, is systemd-free. The desktop environment is KDE and the default theme is one of the most beautiful ones that I have seen so far. The big problem is always tge same: after few times, the system won't boot, hanging infinitely on random services. My 2 cents is that maybe this distro should be tested on a broader spectrum of hardware, though I don't think I have any unusual architecture."
1230,2021-05-24, Redcore Linux, 2101-beta,10,11,"Redcore has been my main operating system since 3/13/21.  I have not had a single crash and everything runs and performs well on my computers.  It takes a long period of time to update, but it functions without any missing software or drivers.  When updating with Sisyphus, be sure to write down and do whatever the text messages tell you to do and you will always have a smooth running and updated system.Most likely, the installation will crash the first time you attempt to install it.  Don't worry, just restart the install program and it should repair itself and install.  Redcore is an automated Gentoo installation program that identifies your computer's processors, video cards, printers, and all.  Basically, the installation program is doing what would take an average person, with experience, a day or more to complete.  Best of all, if Redcore installs it, it is needed. "
1231,2021-03-07, Redcore Linux, 2101-beta,9,6,"Fired up Redcore from a USB stick.  As others have noted, no graphical programs functioned once I activated WIFI, including the installer and terminal.  So much for a live session.  Rebooted and without WIFI the graphical stuff worked fine, so I brought up the installer and installed Redcore on my 8 year old Toshiba laptop, keeping my previous /home partition.After the install everything worked beautifully.  KDE Plasma was not familiar to me; it's pretty intuitive and quite attractive.  The machine is faster and more responsive than in it's previous life on Ubuntu with Gnome - very pleased with performance and feel.I've played with Sisyphus in both the gui and from the command line; downloads are a little slow but worked seamlessly, updating 300 packages in about 45 minutes after the install.   For fun I also installed scrypt from source Gentoo-style using emerge - it was awe-inspiring to watch.Two weeks in and I'm very happy with Redcore so far!  I'm planning to try Gentoo in the future but am intimidated by its complexity.  Redcore is an exceptionally friendly introduction to the Gentoo world, but well worth keeping as a desktop OS on its own merits."
1232,2021-02-17, Redcore Linux, 2101-beta,9,1,I've been using this for daily system on my laptop and I'm really enjoying it.Plasma upgraded and very configurableSisyphus apparently has been rewritten and works great.The system went through a seemingly major package upgrade and was very smooth.

Easy to configure, take a look at the wonderful gentoo wiki, easy to use and you can customize everything. The only thing, so far, that does not work, is sisyphus. Tried to install opera browser, but it does not work. Used ""emerge"" to install it and it works. So I am using emerge for installing progs/apps, no problem.Conclusion: If you are searching for a fast and stable linux-system, try redcore, you will like it.

1237,2023-07-27, Elive, 3.8.34,1,4,"
As other reviewers mentioned raid45 error on installation. This is a known, recurring error wit this distro and you can find  work arounds - note, it is not novice stuff. I tested Elive for 2  weeks and it frequently froze when browsing or using a spreadsheet and requiring rebooting.The snarky multiple requests for money for the distro are unseemly at best.  The developers think  a lot of their product, why that is escapes me.On the positive side it was fairly fast when not freezing.I was expecting a more cutting edge look and feel but Elive comes across as dated and tired.   In the end Elive does not live up to the expectations it deliberately sets. It feels like a company split into fiefdoms.  One where marketing glib gets all the resources and the actual development team is stuck using bubble gum and baling wire to hold things together.  And as for quality control it clearly is next to non-existent. I would love to see their regression and stress testing models.Elive is by far the worst distro have tested.  For a commercial distro (which it actually is,it just masquerades as freeware) it is simply unstable with little to recommend it over other distros that are fully featured and target older hardware.  MX Linux runs circles around it as does various desktop flavors of Mint.  Q4OS would also be a logical choice as would Sparky."

1239,2023-07-21, Elive, 3.8.34,1,3,Well I would like to review Elive on substance but that is sort of difficult as it throws a raid45 error when loading.

E.g. in the past (?) you got the download link after writing a review about Elive ... So, it's hard to find something like the truth: that you are endlessly asked for giving money for a beta version of his work or something based on an outdated version of Debian. I may understand, that the developer nieeds money, but the untrustworthy way he tries to ask for it ..., is ""not so nice"".

I was a bit disappointed that it wasn't possible to remove some of those links from the menu in plank, perhaps in future versions of Enlightenment there is more customizability, but, overall, the system was snappy, it offered a lot of nice designs and has potential to be a lightweight but feature complete OS not just for the old computers.As I am more of a barebones, netinstall and build your own system from the ground up kind of guy, although my 2 weeks with it were quite fun and I only encountered one issue where I could not update my applications unless I did it from the console, I will probably jump back to Debian or try to get FreeBSD running on my computer."

I can only name one other)- Doesn't sell your dataCONS:- Not enterprise-level support- The interface isn't for everyoneThe downloads are sometimes slow, but if you're having trouble hop onto the forum. While the 64-bit version _does_ require you to either donate, write a review, or participate in the forum to download, the 32-bit beta still works flawlessly.I highly recommend this distro except for gaming. While gaming is possible, it is not designed with it in mind (at least at the moment) since the developer doesn't really game. Which is another disadvantage: there's only one developer and occasional volunteers.All in all, solid distro!"
1245,2022-07-11, Elive, 3.8.30,7,7,"It's a good distro, it works well and it's solid because it has an old Debian base. Pros:-uses the desktop Enlightment , which hardly anyone uses anymore. It gives it a retro look and is different from the rest of the distros (I'm already sick of kde). Enligthemnt is heavily modified and looks somewhat more modern.-I have used a 64-bit beta version (3.8.26) and I am surprised how well it works, without errors, it comes with many programs and codecs pre-installed.-Its installer is ""peculiar"" and very reminiscent of the Bluestar distro based on arch.-it has 32 bits version.Cons:-Its website is irritating, where they shamelessly ask you for money all the time, especially for the 64-bit version. It doesn't seem to me that the distro has enough quality or novelty to be asking for money. This fact makes me lower the rating. I remember a distro called Modicia Os: first was free, after was $, and now it has come free again in his basic version.-their versions come out every so often, mine is based on Debian 10 and everything is old, but it works very well for my old PC. It is not oriented to a modern pc.-it is not possible to make change on themes, when you reboot, it comes again withe the original theme. It is not ugly, but it funny to customizate your distro (if you want alwaaaaaaays the same, take Windows or imac Os)."

It's rock-solid stable, the people on the forum are helpful, and I love the Beta's retro desktop. I've contributed a mirror for it so hopefully the downloads will improve.It is still a small distro, though, and there's the occasional hiccup (e.g. getting the 64-bit-only Nvidia drivers to work with Steam, of which there is no official 64-bit client. I fixed this by using Steam's unofficial flatpak). If you need enterprise-level support this distro is probably not fit for you, at least for now. It has great potential, though!"
1247,2021-12-15, Elive, 3.0.4,8,4,"This is a very nice disto.  The only problem I have had (on the stable version) is the lack of an up to date, modern browser.  Normally this is not an issue, but some websites I use will not allow me to access them due to an ""out of date"" browser.  I have gone into the browser settings to make it appear like I am using a more modern browser...  the website registers me as having a new version number, but still tells me the browser is out of date. I am currently using a dual core, 32 bit laptop.  No issues with the OS freezing up.  Once in a while, the browser or some other app will freeze up, but the terminal still works fine and the app can be killed and restarted. I may have to switch to the beta version or maybe another distro for the up to date browser.I wonder about the security of this distro.  The kernel version is old.  It is my understanding that linux is more secure in general for several reasons, one of which is that it is open source and therefore there are a lot of people identifying and fixing security holes.  This project has one developer, but a good community...  so where does that leave Elive in terms of security? "

Using Void Linux for almost two years now, it has firmly established itself as my go-to Linux distribution for various reasons. Its simplicity, minimalism, stability, ease of use, beauty of design, up-to-date packages, and versatility make it an exceptional choice for both newcomers as well as the more experienced Linux users like myself (I am a Linux user since the late 1990s -- Red Hat Linux 4.2 was the first Linux distro I used, soon followed by Slackware). I have found myself relying on Void Linux across different machines for my production work in creative design, particularly for video productions.One of the primary reasons I am drawn to Void Linux is its simplicity. The distribution is designed to be straightforward and uncluttered, providing a clean and efficient user experience. This simplicity extends to the installation process, making it quick and painless to set up on various machines. Whether it's a powerful desktop workstation or a lightweight laptop, Void Linux seamlessly adapts to different hardware configurations without any fuss.Its minimalist approach is another aspect that resonates with me. Void Linux offers a bare-bones installation, allowing users to customize and tailor their environment to their specific needs. I appreciate the freedom it provides in building a system that suits my preferences and workflows without unnecessary bloat.One of the standout features of Void Linux is its stability. Even with its rolling release model, I have experienced consistent performance and reliability throughout my usage. Frequent package updates keep the system fresh, and the Void Linux team ensures that updates are well-tested before release, contributing to its rock-solid stability.Moreover, the ease of use makes Void Linux an ideal choice for users of all levels. The user-friendly package manager, XBPS, offers a simple and intuitive interface for installing, updating, and managing packages effortlessly. I've found myself spending less time tinkering with the system and more time focusing on my creative projects.Beyond functionality, Void Linux boasts a visually pleasing design that enhances the overall user experience. The choice of desktop environments and window managers complements the clean and elegant aesthetics of the system. Its beauty adds to the enjoyment of working on my projects, making it an environment where creativity can flourish.In my work as a filmmaker, Void Linux has consistently met and surpassed my expectations. Its performance, combined with the availability of a wide range of multimedia software and drivers, makes it a capable platform for handling video editing (I use Blender), audio (Audacity), and other creative tasks.In conclusion, Void Linux has become my go-to Linux distribution for its simplicity, minimalism, stability, ease of use, beauty of design, up-to-date packages, and compatibility with my creative design work. Its versatility and reliability across various machines make it an ideal choice for users looking for a productive and visually appealing Linux experience. As I continue to rely on Void Linux for my production work, I look forward to its continued development and growth in the Linux community."

Packages are more limited than if you were using arch or forked arch (artix) for a sysd free install.   However, works fine, a bit of cli config., so not really suitable to someone totally fresh to linux, but if you already have a reasonable amount of knowledge, fancy something different and non-sysd, then this works very well.  Got it with lxqt, lightdm, lightlocker, touchpad gestures and all good.   You can package your own apps too, if something you use is essential but absent from void repo."

1257,2023-07-16, Void, 20230628,8,6,"Tried this on my aged AMD Am3 4 core Phenom CPU based motherboard and Nvidia graphics card. I am presently running Devuan as my daily driver for about 4 years after jumping ship from Solus. My observations are that VOID takes ages, 70 seconds to start and 60 seconds to shut down, unlike Solus that starts in about 18 seconds and 2 seconds to shut down. Devuan takes about 20 seconds to start and 4 seconds to shut down. Once started they all behave virtually the same except that Devuan takes the least memory of about 345mb with Solus taking 1.4gb. Void takes about 580mb. I did not find anything amiss with Void, but it ain't what I expected it to be after reading all the hype about it in the XFCE environment. The only benefit I found out about it was that it has the latest Firefox browser and uses Runnit as the initializer, just like Devuan does. I left Solus mainly due to the fact that it uses SystemD to initialize, which is tantamount to going against the spirit of Linux."
1258,2023-07-12, Void, 20230628,9,0,"stable rolling release, supports multiple cpu architectures and an optional alternative libc (musl). uses xbps, a fast and simple package manager, supports flatpak and nix in their repos (you can use flatpak to install glib-compatible programs in musl if necessary for example, although a good amount of packages are natively supported) and uses runit, minimal init system, instead of systemd, which wont let you down in most use cases at all. popular desktop enviroments like gnome, kde plasma and xfce are supported and xbps-src can be seen as an alternative to getting software not found in the repos (similar to aur)only disadvantage i can think of is the installer itself is a bit incomplete compared to most for example, it'll get the work done but manual work is required to set up full disk encryption (or any way of disk encryption), which is already supported in most other distro installers, automatic partitioning or automatic btrfs installation with subvolumes. but it does get the work done and i notice it does get more features with each updategreat distro overall, definitely worth a try"
1259,2023-07-11, Void, 20230628,10,14,"Void is just the #1 distro by project ranking with over a hundred vote so what can we expect? Astonishing stability for a rolling release distro, speed, low memory footprint, fully customizable. Runit is simple to use and very solid. I personally use Void with Gnome 44.2 at the time of writing this review: a killer combo. The Documentation contains all you need to know really. Those updated images are released at a perfect timing when voidbuilds unofficial images don't ship with void-installer for a undetermined period of time. I'm not afraid of systemd distros but Void kills distro-hopping: it's that good! There's even a funny reddit post entitled ""Void is boring"" because of how rock solid it is and once you're done installing what you want and customizing it, you simply ""sudo xbps-install -Su"" to stay up-to-date. Try it in a VM if you're skeptical and if you like your experience, go ahead and install it on bare metal. I had the best downloading speeds with the Global mirror. You've been warned: once you go void, you never go back! "

1261,2023-06-08, Void, 20221001,10,19,"Void Linux is an independent Linux distribution that is renowned for its speed, versatility, and simplicity. Here are some of the pros and cons of Void Linux:Pros:Fast and lightweight compared to many other distributions.It comes with runit as the default service manager, which is lightweight and efficient.Void Linux has a rolling release model, meaning that the user always has access to the latest software updates.It uses the XBPS package manager, which is simple and easy to use.Void Linux prioritizes simplicity and stability over fancy features.Cons:Void Linux has a small user base, which can lead to a lack of community support and documentation compared to more popular distros.The installation process can be complicated and may require some technical expertise to complete.Some proprietary software may not work due to conflicts with Void Linux's open-source philosophy.While it's not difficult to use, it may take some time for users who are new to Linux to get comfortable with its minimalistic design.Overall, Void Linux is a great option for experienced Linux users looking for a simple and lightweight distribution with a rolling release model. While it may not be the best choice for beginners or users who need access to proprietary software, its speed, simplicity, and efficiency make it an attractive option for those who value those qualities."
1262,2023-06-07, Void, 20221001,10,12,"What I appreciate most about Void is its exceptional clarity, allowing me to understand every aspect of my operating system.Void is the most user-friendly Linux distribution I have ever used. It simplifies everything remarkably, adhering closely to the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle. Moreover, it boasts impressive speed and stability, while also evoking a BSD-like experience.The package manager is incredibly straightforward to configure and operates at lightning speed. I have never encountered any issues with upgrades, as they have always been stable and reliable. Though the number of available packages is impressive for a niche distribution, I personally prefer running Nix in parallel for greater control and access to additional packages.Working with runit (the init process) is a pleasure, as I can comprehensively understand each step of the boot process and customize it according to my requirements.I had reservations about Arch due to systemd, Gentoo due to lengthy compilation times and portage, and Artix due to its inconsistent package manager. However, I love Void for its utilization of runit, xbps (the package manager), and its overall stability.Every one of my machines runs on Void, and I am currently in the process of testing it on my server, where it has performed flawlessly so far.The positives of Void are:    Runit (I highly recommend trying it; it is truly remarkable)    xbps and its impressive mirror speed    Strong documentationHowever, there are a few downsides:    While the documentation is excellent, it could be more comprehensive, similar to the Arch Wiki or the Gentoo Wiki.    It would be beneficial to have an option in xbps to test a package, either through a subshell like Nix or with the ability to remove a package using xbps-remove -o.    The installation process is not as enjoyable as Gentoo or Arch, as it provides more guidance (although this does not result in a bloated system).I have tried numerous distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, Arch, Gentoo, Artix, and OpenBSD. In my opinion, Void comes closest to OpenBSD in terms of consistency and simplicity while still delivering the performance expected from a modern desktop system.Once you enter the Void, you will find that Void becomes your final Linux distribution."

1275,2023-01-23, Void, 20221001,9,1,"Kind of an incredible distro. I've been using it for about 3 or 4 months now. Installing it took me a bit to understand. The installer is straightforward enough but I had no previous experience partitioning drives, so I basically copied someone else's recommended settings from a youtube tutorial. I broke the system, but then read some more and finally figured it out. In the end, ironically, it only takes about 5 minutes to compile and install the system. I used xbps to pull down most of my list of software apps, and I was able to use my Ubuntu i3 dotfiles pretty close to 1-for-1 for all my software. I haven't needed to mess around much with runit yet but the few times I did it was straightforward and I found examples from other folks online of what I needed to do.For package management I installed vpm to use (a wrapper around xbps that simplifies it), which makes it work pretty much the same as apt or even slightly simpler now (since updating also upgrades).  I love that the packages are newer than the options on my previous Ubuntu-based system, and that even though they're more up to date, I don't fear them breaking. Just to be safe I back up my files and programs at least weekly, but I don't anticipate any major breakages in case one day the rolling release messes me up, but so far everyone on the (mostly) friendly void subreddit have seem to say that updates breaking things rarely or almost never happen.Once getting a nice setup going on Void I haven't been continually tweaking and refining the way I used to do on i3/Ubuntu or other systems. I'm just straightforwardly happy with my system. I'm running this on an Alienware desktop a couple years old. It flies so fast. Have been able to get games to work fine for me. I don't feel like I'm missing anything. And it's a pleasure to write code and do development work and graphic design and game design on this system.I'm feeling really thankful I've stumbled across Void and I pushed through the slight complications of getting it installed properly."
1276,2023-01-07, Void, 20221001,10,16,"Void is a great distro for experienced Linux admins/devs, offering even more flexibility than Arch. The core is very minimalist and may not be immediately functional, as it is not built for a ""distro-hopper"" but for someone who understands and is interested in the functional aspects, such as: musl libc option, ARM option (e.g. raspberry pi), ability to cross-compile pacakges with xbps-src, optional systemd (and almost everything else). I have installed void on both a fairly powerful tower (ryzen 7, rx 580) and a fairly crappy laptop (dual-core celeron N3050, 2G ram) and have been daily driving it on the tower for nearly two years. In that time I experienced one instance where I froze during the boot sequence, due to a kernel regression (this can happen with any rolling release distro). I was able to boot using the live ISO from a USB drive, mount my hard drive manually, and roll back the kernel. Within an hour or two, Void linux IRC chat had helped me identify the problem and I used a workaround until the next kernel release.I do NOT recommend Void for new users, certainly not the musl option. I myself started with Ubuntu (at work), then Mint, then Manjaro, then Arch and now Void (still on glibc). This progression from ""it just works"" distros down to Void makes for a more reasonable learning experience. And now that I'm here, I'm not going back. I still use Arch linux on one of my machines only because I haven't been bothered to switch over yet. But the setup is mostly the same: sway WM with autotiling, qutebrowser for web, alacritty (terminal) for almost everything else. No login manager or DM. Like another review said, void is best administered from the command line. I have briefly tried BSD as well which felt similar, but less modern and functional in my opinion. For example, on Void, I was able to run steam games using Proton.Here's an overview of the pros/cons:Pros:- very light core, even systemd is optional- very flexible, offering ARM and musl versions and a package creation suite with cross-compilation capability- active IRC chat for support- large repositories considering the size of the community and age, partly because of the nice xbps-* suite- one of the best package modern management suites (xbps-* tools) that is fully functional like pacman unlike the rather academic guix or nix experiments (which are interesting in their own right)- offline manual with decent basic documentation (accessible even in roff format from the vt console)- rolling release (I consider this a pro, not everyone likes this e.g. for servers)- good hardware support, basically like ArchCons:- takes time to set up, not a plug-n-play distro (it's Linux after all)- small community means updates to niche packages can be slow- repository mirrors can be slow and need to be monitored, the Australian mirror stopped pulling upstream updates and I didn't realise for a while (someone should port Arch's reflector...)- lacking polish in some areas, of the top of my head e.g. the recommended log reader svlogtail is underdocumented, ISO images can be old and use dash shell (not user friendly) and the manual is a bit too spartan (there is always the Arch wiki for most things)I haven't tried musl nor ARM yet but I'm waiting for a raspberry pi pico (and some free time) to see what I can do with it. I have seen multiple blogs from people who have installed it on rPi though, so it should work."
1277,2022-12-09, Void, 20221001,10,15,"Void Linux is extremely minimalist. Its installer is the fastest, easiest and simplest I've ever seen. The user needs to search for the necessary and correct packages to install the applications. The result is a very fast, customized, lean distro. Excellent for old machines. The xbps package manager is incredibly fast and easy, the best Linux package manager.Void Linux is a great alternative to Arch Linux, it has its qualities without systemd. Runit is cleaner. I am very satisfied with the end result."
1278,2022-11-29, Void, 20221001,10,24,"After years of distro hopping, I settled on Fedora for a few years. After more and more obscure tools that powered my workflow weren't available on Fedora, I jumped ship and went back to hopping. A friend recommended Void, and it's been working great for me the past 3 years now. It's very stable, while still providing fairly up-to-date packages. Support for less common architectures, and a very welcoming community that makes contributing easy were the other things that drew me in, because as a user on a Pinebook Pro, I didn't want to locally compile each updated package. So, the solution was to contribute the slow compiling rust packages I needed to the official repository, and my PBP would receive binary packages from there. Worked out great for me."
1279,2022-11-23, Void, 20221001,10,25,"Void is a very simple, minimalistic and bloat-free. Linux distro. I have installed it on my laptop without any problems so far. It reminds me of Arch with which they share the same ""kiss"" philosophy but without systemd. It boots very fast, faster than Arch i'd say, its repositories include a large number of software and it has xbps which is a nice package manager and easy to use. I have installed my printer sofrtware and also nvidia optimuss for my secondary graphics with prime  without any issues. I use xfce desktop but changed the default lxdl display manager with lightdm which for me has better interface.I  have no cons to report yet."
1280,2022-11-22, Void, 20221001,1,0,"I foolishly tried this distro because of YouTube recommendations. Big mistake! Couldn't get thunar or pcmanfm to recognise external hdd or usb until I found a suggestion about using udevil. Vim keeps throwing error messages. Basically, this distro is just a dreadful waste of my time, unlike every other de or tiling window manager that I have installed on Arch.  As an example of Void time wasting, I always install gvfs with thunar. The preferences page then kept telling me that 'perhaps gvfs isn't available'. It took me hours to work out how to get the startup to recognise the SDDM display manager. The documentation makes no mention of needing to add a symbolic link for dbus. I am quite a seasooned Linux user and I won't give Void Linux another second of my time."
1281,2022-11-08, Void, 20221001,10,22,"My BackgroundI am new to Linux; after 20 years of using windows, I needed to breath life back into an aging laptop. I started looking into Linux systems, as they were rumored to be light on resources. I started with Linux Mint, then moved to Fedora. After a few months, I felt comfortable enough in the command line to want to try and configure a system without a point and click installation. Enter Linux Void! After reading through the documentation, I decided to dual boot Void. It took me a few tries to successfully install and here we are. It forced me to learn how to partition and then mount the partition, as well as Swap and EFI. I'm sure this will get a few chuckles but what I'm getting at, is this is a great experience. When things don't work, the documentation is available and the answer is buried inside it somewhere. As it does not seem to be a 'mainstream' Operating System, a web search usually does not yield the answers to a problem I'm facing. This forces me to understand what the problem is, instead of to solve it with a simple copy and paste from the web. Had I attempted becoming proficient at using this distribution without other introductory experiences (LM, Fedora) I would have most likely gone back to windows out of frustration.This leads to my review. Without a strong computer background, I would recommend this not be an introduction to Linux. I found everything well organized, simple, and clean. I have not discovered any errors or discrepancies from the documentation during my use. BUT, not everything is available and integrated like with other systems. It takes some tinkering to get things going. My usual web browser is not available from the xbps package manager. So that means I'm building it (or resorting to flatpak). I also have been discovering bash scripts out of necessity. I cannot stress enough, this has been and continues to be a learning experience. So if you are not proficient with Linux be prepared to learn or this might not be an enjoyable experience.   Thank you to the development team for the excellent work!"
1282,2022-10-27, Void, 20221001,10,24,"Challenging, but rewarding.Install only those applications you need, the desktop you want. Services are enabled by the user manually and run via runit, not systemd. You'll find no odd, unknown, or other software that is not needed running on your machine. Unless you put it there.The documentation is short and to the point. Everything that you need to know in order to install, configure, and add a desktop with applications is explained on the void website. After going into distro hopping mode for a few weeks I came back to void, mainly because everything that I need works without fluff or drama. KDE/Plasma, Steam, printing, scanning, sound, Falkon browser and kdeconnect all up and running fine.If new to Linux you will learn a lot during setup. Read through the documentation and understand it before you begin. If you are old to Linux you will appreciate the control and speed that void provides."
1283,2022-10-27, Void, 20221001,10,23,"Easy to work with, without excessive layers of abstraction. The Runit init system is excellent both for package installed daemons and for daemons you code up yourself. Lots of packages, all the usual suspects, although a few esoteric packages are missing. Due to the rolling release model, packages tend to be more modern than most other distros. Unlike some rolling releases, Void seldom chokes on updates, and when it does, you can usually wait a few hours until the packages are rebuilt. However, updates become harder if you wait more than a month between updates. I do updates every couple days. Void packages a full compliment of window managers and desktop environments so you can have the exact workflow you want. Support via the #voidlinux IRC channel is quick and helpful.Void isn't for the raw newbie. Installation isn't dead-bang obvious, and  Void isn't as hardware-forgiving as Ubuntu or Mint. Void is an outstanding distro for those who graduate the newbie stage and take off the training wheels.My perception of Void Linux is it's a distribution for people who want to boss their computer rather than having their computer boss them."
1284,2022-10-26, Void, 20221001,10,25,"After many years with most famous Linux distros, Void feels like a fresh and new world, so fast and bloat free !It makes linux experience delightful with fast, extremely responsive. simple OS.Runit init system should be default in all Linux OS for its speed and simplicity!Gives control to users to decide what they want from their OS and does not come in between user and thier jobs.Such a quality Linux OS should be in top 20 list.Thanks to the developers of this excellent OS!Try it once to see the difference!"
1285,2022-10-24, Void, 20221001,10,26,"Minimal and lightweight. I like that it feels similar to BSD in many ways. The XBPS package manager seems fine and dandy so far. I much prefer the runit init system over systemd. Fast and simple. No black boxes.My initial intention was to configure Openbox or dwm, but I am still groovin' on Xfce for the time being. It feels very fast and responsive on my not-so-stellar hardware.I really can't think of anything bad to say about Void. True, it does require additional effort to get a fully working system, so it is not for everyone. But the reward for your extra effort is a fast, minimal system that works just the way you want it to.If you have a bit of Linux experience under your belt, give Void a try!"
1286,2022-09-10, Void, 20210930,10,21,"A small, minimalist distribution with good repositories, a lightning fast package manager, comes with the packages it needs to function while remaining smaller than arch, doesn't need internet to install, and honestly seems to ""just work"". I found this to be a far better way of doing minimalist linux than arch, and the runit system is easy enough to use. I would most definitely recommend this distro for anyone looking for something lightweight and extremely functional. As an added bonus it also if fast to get up and running, as much as the arch style chroot install gives you control, having to do everything manually when all you need is a basic installation is a waste of time, the chroot style install is still there for those that want it, but the option to use an installer is very nice."

Documentation - to the point and mostly adequate.I used it for about six months when version 20210218 ISOs were released and I was very satisfied with the CINNAMON desktop. Briefly was away to windows and missed void too much. Finally returned to void couple of weeks ago. Disappointed to see that they now publish only XFCE ISO. I would request to publish the CINNAMON ISO instead. Their CINNAMON desktop is exceptionally well-cooked and is anytime better than XFCE!Nonetheless, I installed the 20210218 CINNAMON ISO and XBPS upgraded it to latest, with just one hiccup - that of the 'certificate invalid' error which seem to be a more general issue at one point and that is not because of upgrading from an age old installation ISO.I would like void to add MotionBox or some application that can play videos not just from youtube, but from general web.Cheers to the Void team and the community around it."
1288,2022-08-28, Void, 20210930,10,10,"Very good distro if you are looking for something simple and fast, that at the same time, can make you learn more about Linux. Void's documentation is very easy to understand and straight to the point, so it doesn't get too tiring to read.Here you don't have systemd, but runit, which is much less resource-hungry and extremely simple to use, as well as to script your own services. On the other hand, it does not have a service manager, nor can it handle their dependencies by itself, so it is something to keep in mind.Void's xbps package manager is also quite solid and fast and although it doesn't quite catch up to pacman in this sense, it is much more cohesive with the commands, although they are a bit lengthy and can be a bit awkward at first, but nothing that an alias can't handle if you want to. Void also offers a recipe repository for packages that are not in the ""official"" ones, similar to AUR, which can be used to package them. Although some packages are not on pair with upstream, here the stability will be greater than in a bleeding edge distro, which I particularly prefer.Another point I like is that it is independent, and has its ""own"" style, with some of its own tools written from scratch. I am very satisfied with Void as a whole, long life to it."

The provided ISO images are almost a year old, several packages haven't been updated in a long time, some of extreme importance, like both libc implementations (glibc, for example, still uses a version from two years ago!). Many people keep asking if the Void ""died"" for some of these reasons, and despite the answer being ""no"", it constantly seems to be in a terminal state. I've been on Void for a few months, and it's complicated, even some PRs you open sometimes seem to be simply ignored for the time they take to be accepted or denied (when there is any response), as it will depend solely on the interest of some core team member. Apparently there aren't any devs who work full time on Void, so even update PRs sometimes take a while to get accepted. The system itself is ok, when it doesn't have certain bugs on certain hardware, as was my case with touchpad (maybe something with the kernel), and bluetooth. It's a bit overrated for the current situation, which seems to be degrading over time."

Refer to the Handbook for an overview.Additionally, Void has a system called xbps-src, inspired by NetBSD's pkgsrc, that can build natively or cross compile for the target machine, and supports multiple C libraries (glibc and musl currently) letting the user use the more secure and fast C library alternative.Overall, if you have not tried Void, do it.

This distro doesn't even come with the screenshooter which is just sad, had to acquire that package right after ""screenFetch"".Had to decide between ""glibc"" or ""musl"" for 64-bit.  Felt adventurous and thus picked the latter.  Maybe it's just my computer.  It's a 10-year-old laptop that was handed down, originally came with Windows8 and actually has last year's disgusting update instead, and also Manjaro and Solus.  It has a *real* hard drive not internal SSD, but it's very slow.  This OS is difficult to recommend because, after install and updating, it comes up with no sound and one has to install packages to fix it.  Not sure if I obtained Pulse Audio successfully.  If someone really wants a volume icon on the system tray, must install another package for that and must add it to the ""session"".  Be forewarned: Wine is 64-bit only on ""musl"".  Even worse it *refuses to run anything* that comes in a Windows installer.  I managed to run the latest 64-bit OpenMPT but that's all, and it produced no sound.  It forced me to dump ""musl"" in favor of ""glibc"".  Went to install 32-bit Wine after the ""standard"" Wine but the ""xbps"" packaging system refused unless I downloaded *another package* to enable ""multilib"" repositories.  No problems afterward.

1299,2022-07-10, Void, 20210930,10,15,"Void Linux is such a great Distro. I have tried many, many Distros, however no other Distro (even Arch) has a better base than Void Linux. The things that I look at a Distro is the package manager, the init system, the bloat that a Distro may have and if the Distro suits my use case. My biggest use cases are:- Playing video games on Steam while talking to friends (if applicable ;-;) on Discord and listening to Music on Spotify- Recording videos on OBS and editing them in Shotcut- Programming- Customizing a desktop (Cinnamon or Xfce suits me)What I also would like to have in a Distro as an option (it is not mandatory to be pre-installed):- Flatpak- AppImageLauncher- NVIDIA Drivers- adbVoid Linux does all of that the best because of how fast it is. No other Distro takes less resources than Void Linux does, which I have searched for some time as well as I only have 8 GB. I use Void Linux with a Cinnamon Desktop Environment, and it feels responsive and fast. After the installation, you only have a Xfce Desktop, Mozilla Firefox as a web browser and a display manager in terms of graphical software, which I really like. From that on you can start including things that you would like to have on your operating system.Here are the pros and cons that I have:Pros:- Fast installer: Maybe not an easy installer, but very fast. It takes like less than 5 minutes to install it if you know what you're doing.- Runit: Very fast and is a breath of fresh air from all the systemd-based Distros- Xbps: Huge repositories as well (see above).- Not bloated.- Stable: Void Linux is bleeding edge with being stable as well.- Good documentation: Not Arch Linux level, but pretty good as well as a helpful Subreddit.- Independent Linux Distro: I like Independent Distros. I like it when a Distro doesn't have to rely on another Distro because it's a fork. With that Void Linux is free from flaws that Distros such as Salix have.+/- Some desktop environments had issues. GNOME's version was a little behind before (now changed though). KDE Plasma's themes store had an error that I couldn't fix as well.+/- It's not easy to use. Now for me this is not a problem, but may be.Cons:- Void Linux still uses LXDM: I would like to have LightDM by default instead because LXDM is not really maintained. Sure you can change it, but this is a change, that they could've made.- ISOs are very old: Now this is not really needed, but for a rolling release Distro, these are damn old.- Some symbols are not being rendered: I couldn't fix it sadly, but I believe that it may not be Void Linux's problem.So this review is very long because I appreciate Void Linux. It's unique, not for everybody, it's fast, and it suits my needs. I want to see this Distro be better and better.Also, to that one person who had issues with Steam: Use the Steam xbps package as I had many issues with Steam as a Flatpak. So it's not Void Linux's problem. Just get the nonfree repos (see Void Linux's documentation) and do (for NVIDIA users at least)...sudo xbps-install -S libgcc-32bit libstdc++-32bit libdrm-32bit libglvnd-32bit nvidia nvidia-libs-32bitThis distro is amazing.

First off, as a rolling release, it really is stable as opposed to just promising to be that way and then acting the opposite. The installation certainly isn't Calamares but it's logical to navigate and there are ample step-by-step guides you can follow. I used one of them to install KDE after completing a base network install and the whole process was flawless. There was no sound but a quick Google search threw up a Reddit post for this and two terminal commands later everything was working. The speed is amazing even on a low powered Celeron desktop.  What additional software that isn't in their own repos will be in Flatpak for most users. A great system.

SmartOS is designed to handle the biggest of datacentres but it will equally work well for desktop servers. It is on desktops and laptops where I see the brightest future for SmartOS. It is lacking a good intuitive GUI for primary management, but it has the capability to surpass all existing desktop OSes by being a desktop hypervisor of the future. It is in this role where any existing OS can be installed and run under the desktop hypervisor (SmartOS) and allow files and functions from one OS to interact with another OS all with complete security and separation.I have never seen this approach used in such a manner as I am describing, but I can see a tremendous potential for this approach to mould itself into an operating system to dominate all desktop systems into the future. It has the potential to remove many interoperability problems and allow existing operating systems to evolve into a holistic future OS.Of course, this is not what the creators intended, but it is a vision that I can see possible. And that is something that I thought would never be possible. I hope this insight will inspire people to make it happen.

I've been using it as my main phone OS for few years now with no major issues. Sometimes some odd application refuses to cooperate properly with the OS claiming it is a rooted system, but I did manage to convince few app suppliers to allow e/OS and now most of these apps work fine. It does great job in replacing google services. I tried LineageOS before using e/OS and regularly experienced issues. Not here.Otherwise it is a solid Android experience with a lot of customisation that can be added. Personally didnt like the original launcher it ships with, and find Fairphone2 launcher (available from F-Droid) to be much more user friendly."

This is a pretty solid Android custom ROM with all the bells and whistles you come to expect, except without any Google services. One complaint I have is that once the device you install the OS on becomes unsupported, it becomes practically unusable. It's also quite hard to use this as an actual day-to-day phone, seeing as most apps rely on the bare minimum Google services being installed, and getting those to work on this phone is a pain. It also doesn't do anything special to stand out from other Android custom ROMs, and that's kind of disappointing."

I've recently installed as a dual boot system on a new mini computer. It took several attempts to get Grub2 to recognize and install properly. Also, the ISO is so old, that when attempting to do an update, it had well over 1600 updates to make and things inevitably failed during the update - a lot of error messages. One persistent error was was with the Nvidia repository. Apparently this has been an ongoing issue. Since I have no Nvidia hardware, I just deleted that repository through Yast. Solved one update problem.I then went to the terminal, refreshed repositories (sudo zypper refresh -f -s), then updated the system through the terminal with some added parameters (sudo zypper dup --no-allow-vendor-change --no-recommends). Adding these parameters allowed the update to continue without any major hitches. I do believe these update issues were caused by the very old ISO that is offered for install - over a year old ISO is not good for a rolling release - too much opportunity for breakage. Since doing this, Gecko seems to be running fine, I do like the ease of set-up, but after the update, I lost the wallpaper from Gecko, and have only the Tumbleweed wallpapers available - small issue. I will continue testing this, since I do like the idea of OpenSuse, just not the configuration hassles.

Something mainstream in terms of underlying operating system such as Debian, Ubuntu or RHEL5.

There are many Debian distros that add the non-free world, codecs and wifi, but a distro was missing in opensuse that has the same.

GeckoLinux smartly configures the system to get you up and running in no time. What you are left with is openSUSE Tumbleweed with all the needed repos & codecs added, improved fonts, all essential apps installed & various other tweaks to save time after install. Is openSUSE a beginner distro? Not really, more like an intermediate user distro. But if you take the time to do a little research, you have a system that, at least in the case of XFCE, is lightning fast, always up to date & as reliable as any Linux system I have used in the last 14 years. Also by having BTRFS combined with snapper, which is now standard in a GeckoLinux install, I have the security of knowing that if an update goes south, a simple roll back will get me going again. There is no system anywhere that makes rolling back to a prior snapshot as easy as openSUSE. I have distro hopped a lot over the years, but since I installed Gecko, I have no desire to go anywhere else.

Upon reboot I still get dumped in rescue mode on the EFI machines. So I cannot use it without doing manual configuration the stock OpenSUSE Tumbleweed actually doesn't need which partly defeats the object of Gecko in the first place as a more consumer friendly OpenSUSE.From what I have seen of it on the one legacy machine and in live environment on the others it's not too shabby and far quicker to boot than stock openSUSE.

This is because the available software is really a lot.The default filesystem is not btrfs, but I think this is correct for this desktop oriented distro (however you can change it if you like)."

All the more remarkable because it appears to be the work of just one developer - kudos & respect goes out to whoever that might be!

Started out with Ubuntu, which seemed to get progressively worse for speed and support of systems older than 5 years. The last 3 or 4 years I've settled in with Mint (until it too got too bloated), Peppermint and MX Linux. For really old hardware I've had great luck with BunsenLabs. MX seems to be getting a little ""sloppy"" lately, so I started to look around somewhere out of the Deb/buntu realm. I wanted to love Manjaro, but it seems to ""break"" after a few days/weeks of updates and I don;t have time to constantly re-tweak it.When I've tried OpenSUSE directly i wasn't that impressed with all the configuration ""tweaks"" required, then in some review I discovered Gecko XFCE. I installed it easily; configured my old Brother printer and I've been off to the races. Gecko boots very lively on a converted Macbook Pro 2009 with 8gb RAM. The old toadie Broadcom driver and NVIDEA driver worked out of the box. A lot of distros have dropped support for the bcm43xx series of drivers, apparently.Gecko is fast, doesn't break easily and allows me to get a days work done without having to worry about crashed and freezes on this machine. Love this distro. If it continues to do as well as it has the past couple of weeks, I'm gong to install on my production desktop, which currently runs MX 19.3."

No problems or issues till now. Very easy to use and immediately ready out of the box.Very suggested to Windows switchers and to all the people don't want to lose a lot of time for the configurations.Thank you so much to the developers!Keep going this way!Greetings from Italy!"
1360,2023-07-29, Zorin OS, 16.3,10,7,"Zorin is one of those distros when you're tired of hopping around. You try to replace it but realize that your computer is about getting tasks accomplished first and foremost. Sometimes you dont need a hobbyist distro, sometimes you just need things to work. Even if its not your primary os, definitely give this a try. I bought the $40 pro version, mainly to just support the project as they're doing great work. It's a distro I will eventually put on my mom/dads computer for ease of use, but a distro I can still use due to its packages, package installers, layout, and general comfiness. You wont impress your arch/gentoo friends with it, but you will be doing far less work maintaining your machine like they will. "
1361,2023-07-28, Zorin OS, 16.3,10,8,"I use primarily the Core version and it is fantastic. Very clean and polished interface. Solid, static, stable release with newer packages from their own repositories. I especially like their software store - it has a graphical user interface for Ubuntu packages, Debian packages, Snap packages, and Flatpaks. AppImages are available too. The Zorin brothers have created a distribution that is cohesive and easy to use with minimal fuss of where to get the packages/programs. Plus, you can still install Synaptic or use the terminal. The base is older with Zorin OS usually running behind the Ubuntu LTS release. Currently 16.3 is based on the older Ubuntu 20.04 LTS released April 2020 and Zorin OS 17 will be based on newer Ubuntu 22.04 LTS from April 2022. By the time 17 is released in a few months, we will be a few months away from the Ubuntu 24.04 LTS release - for some users this might be a problem since Zorin is never on the newest/current base. With Zorin OS the base is irrelevant and for the majority of users. The best part is recently they came out with an upgrade tool that allows you to upgrade from 15 to 16 and later 16 to 17 without having to reinstall the operating system. Or you can upgrade from free Core version to the $39USD paid version. This new feature puts Zorin on-par with Ubuntu, Mint or Pop!_OS in ease of use and ease of upgrade. Great distribution for new Linux users or experienced Linux users like me. I like it because everything works right and there is no troubleshooting needed to make things function as they should. Zorin OS works especially well on a laptop too - it has Wayland and gestures by default plus... wobbly windows! The GNOME desktop is the older 3.38 perhaps but the new 17 version coming out later this year will have a newer GNOME 42 I think which is on the Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. This is not the latest but it is more modern. Again, it is not much of an issue since Zorin customizes the desktop to create their own look/feel and offers several layouts from a traditional desktop like Windows or something modern like GNOME. If you are new to Linux don't waste your time - just install Zorin OS (or Linux Mint Cinnamon) and you will have everything you need and more to get things done."

Things run decently quickly even on this old 11-inch Dell 3180 machine with 32gb emmc storage and 4 gb of RAM. Zorin also attempts to fill in the space left behind by old ""boxed desktop Linux"" distributions like Mandrake and Xandros, especially as mainstream Ubuntu (which Zorin is based on) and Red Hat have pivoted to focus more on the enterprise space.Zorin is perfect for prolonging the lifespan of old machines (with its Lite edition), new Windows switchers who want a familiar environment, education settings, and small businesses who need the reliability of paid-support. I don't mind paying for a Linux distro as long as they are upfront about what you're getting (in Zorin's case paid support) and aren't misrepresenting themselves and charging for free as in beer software like Lindows/Linspire did in the early 2000s with their Synaptic front-end CNR."

Added to this the OS looks great too, unlike many other OS's that appear clunky by comparison.I have hopped about a lot and tried many other distros but Zorin OS is always my return go to when others fail to impress or simply have not got the same stability.Of course with any distro we all have our useer preferences as to how they look and feel, personally I like the task bar at the top and to add plank dock at the bottom as it seems more instictive in use. As said, customising is easily achieved with the Zorin OS XFCE desktop.Overall, a great, uncomplicated distro and not trying to be too clever where many are failing! "
1365,2023-07-02, Zorin OS, 16.2,5,2,"The os is beautiful, fully featured and fast and I really do like it. The issue for me is that I bought a new laptop and installed zorin 16.2 and some of the hardware did not work.This is because it is using a relatively old kernel by todays standards. It will work fine if you have a laptop between 2014 and 2020 but not after or before these years generally. Preceding 2014, it will be too slow because it is too heavy and after 2020, newer hardware simply wont work and wont be seen by the operating system even if you compile the driver yourself.In my case the webcam and the fingerprint reader did not work because zorin is still on ubuntu 20.04 with its kernel.You also cannot upgrade the kernel and i have tried, it wont boot, so your stuck with a new laptop.Its a shame because its a beautiful os that is let down by dated foundation.Another issue I encountered was because it uses gnome as the base, it has the gnome-software process which memory leaks and slows down older systems because it over utilises the ram.This process seems to start leaking when you install apps and continues to rise.Zorin also does not play nice with gnome tweaks.Steer clear if you have a post 2020 laptop.When zorin developers start updating to an expected standard and stop following older ubuntu lts versions, I might give it another look.There is old, stable up to date and bleeding edge but unfortunately zorins back end is just old. Zorin 17 will be based off 22.04 of ubuntu and will have the same issue with newer laptops.Tests were done on a hp pavillion 14 ec0537sa."

Previously, I had the best experience with openSuse Tumbleweed, but I ran into problems with a kernel update.  After spending a ton of time debugging, it was just apparent it was time to give up and try something else.Came across Zorin OS on this site.  Sounded like something that might fit my use case, as I wanted a stable distro that would not randomly update something important and I'd be stuck reinstalling again. I installed Zorin Core on the MBP and Zorin Lite on the Dell about a month ago, and I couldn't be happier.  I think I've found a distro for these two computers that I can trust to work for quite some time.Easy install, even installed the wifi and graphics drivers for the MBP, which are often something I need to do post-install via CLI.  Beautiful interface and easy to customize as it comes with a custom Zorin Appearance control panel that allows you to change desktop themes in the GUI (not a common feature of Linux distros)."

Everywhere on forums and various sites, this system was presented as an alternative to Windows and MacOS. Since I used to use on my old laptop Lenovo G575 with 2 GB ram and integrated graphics on Linux mint 17 board, later I bought an older Lenovo B50-30 4 GB ram and ran it on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. What did not suit me in Ubuntu were frequent problems with wi-fi, spontaneous disconnection of sound and problems with stability (while Canonical itself declares how stable their system is), so I decided that it would be more ideal to use some derivative of Ubuntu. at first it was Mint again, but somehow I didn't like the same desktop scheme anymore. then I caught Zorin OS 16 based on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, I tell myself that I won't give anything for the test. I don't know why, but every time I decide to try another distro, I always end up going back to zorin. The desktop, connectivity, reliability is on a completely different level than the base from which it is derived.+ Stability+ design+ Zorin connect+ speed and clarity, simplicity- HDMI input, when connected to the TV I have to manually adjust the sound from the internal speakers to the TV and vice versa when disconnected. in the new version, they could add some dialogue box where they ask me when connecting, whether to adjust the sound, or even better not to ask at all and just plug it in :)"

1373,2023-05-01, Zorin OS, 16.2,7,5,"Zorin is actually the distro that got me into Linux and I would have to give them a ton of credit for that. It has a BEAUTIFUL interface, friendly support, and AWESOME wine integration. However besides that, I just can't recommend them to anyone besides ABSOLUTE beginners or people on really good hardware.First of all, I noticed for some unknown reason, the desktop kept on lagging for no reason. I blamed that on my old laptop, but it got to the point where it just completely froze, and when I tried to boot this distro it wouldn't boot. Since this was my first time using it, I decided to give it another chance and reinstalled it (I had to do it twice as when I did it the first time, the installer crashed). It went really well and it didn't take long to get all my apps back in place. That was when I discovered timeshift and wanted to create a separate partition to store my timeshift backups and some other personal files. So I went to a live disk to resize the partitions. Guess What? The gparted crashed and the distro wouldn't boot again. I ended up restoring from a timeshift backup, which didn't work. I was just having a real headache which this distro and installed Linux Mint. WOW OMG! It was fast, everything seemed to integrate really well, the installer didn't crash, gparted disk resize didn't crash either, and there was a ton of support on the internet. Sure the interface and WINE integration isn't as great, but those are 2 small things I would be willing to trade for faster speed, better documentation on the internet, and better reliability (notice how I didn't say stability). For most people，I would recommend Linux Mint for beginners, OpenSUSE for people who want the most reliable/stable distro and/or people who are Windows power users, and EndeavourOS for developers, gamers, and people who want the newest technology.TL;DR: Zorin is great for Linux Beginners, people who want good Windows Apps support, and people who have good hardware. I won't recommend people who want something more than a ""beginner's distro"", somebody with moderate to older hardware (including lite), people who value reliability，and people who want something that won't get in their way all the time."
1374,2023-04-24, Zorin OS, 16.2,9,0,"I have been using Zorin on and off for about 3.5 years. Great distribution. Everything looks consistent and everything works fast.Some people complain about the Ubuntu base being old (all to common among Linux fanboys). Their 16 series Zorin came out about 16 months after Ubuntu 20.04 and that is the base for Zorin OS 16. They come out with their versions significantly after the most recent Ubuntu. Ubuntu 22.04 came out about a year ago - expect Zorin 17 based on Ubuntu's 22.04 LTS base to come out sometime between July and December 2023 based on what the Zorin developers have posted on their website. For some people that may be a limitation but it really does not hurt the OS.Anyway, I say all this because the age of the base is NOT relevant with Zorin OS. They tweak and polish the packages to look consistent and work right with Zorin - that's why it takes them time to put out the next version I suppose. Furthermore, they have the newest packages for their default programs with their own PPA repositories. They back-port newer packages like LibreOffice which makes the base moot. One nice feature of Zorin is that it includes Ubuntu/Debian packages, Snap packages, and Flatpak pages by default. Nothing additional to install to get Flatpaks and Snaps. Also, Flatpaks & Snaps offer you newer packages that again, is another reason the underlying Ubuntu base is not that important.The one thing that I would like to see on Zorin is what Canonical has on their flavors - the ability to upgrade from within the OS and not have to do a fresh installation in order to upgrade. The developers are promising that feature. Will it be on Zorin 17? That is unknown for now. But that is definitely one feature many people including myself would like to see that other distributions like Pop!_OS, Mint, and Ubuntu already have.Regardless, Zorin is fast and looks good too. It is simple for the new user and has all the features an advanced user needs/wants. It has a few layouts on Zorin Core which makes it look better than traditional GNOME. Their Lite version based on Xfce is good too but I prefer the GNOME version which is Zorin Core. The Pro version is $39 which gives you some support with installation, additional pre-installed packages, and a few additional layouts. If you are thinking of giving Zorin a donation, just give them the $39 and you get a few extra features. Most experienced Linux users probably won't need the Pro version.Zorin is a very nice Ubuntu based distribution that is rock solid, looks great and is very stable."
1375,2023-04-14, Zorin OS, 16.2,8,1,"I’m kind of a veteran Linux user so probably not the most obvious “target” of Zorin still I value simplicity, user-friendliness and every effort to bring my OS of choice to the “masses”. I installed and thoroughly tested Zorin Lite 16.1 in one of my machines which was uneventfully upgraded to 16.2 in the meantime.“Looks” is an asset in my books but not the ultimate criterion by which to judge a distribution. Zorin surely has the looks though the effort to simulate the feeling of Windows and MacOS is evident in its choice of palette. Zorin’s custom-themed Xfce looks polished and the desktop layout is absolutely sensible and functional. Nevertheless there is a single detail which is almost a deal-breaker for me. Other will find this inessential. It is a classic “bug” in certain themed Xfce (and sometimes Mate) desktops: the mouse cursor is offset when you try to diagonally resize application windows. It is very annoying to me. There are many threads on Zorin forum about it but proposed solutions are either installing third-party themes or editing the default one. Not acceptable when it comes to a distro which aspires to work out of the box and on top of that to charge its users for using a premium version. Linux Mint 19.3 Xfce for instance shipping its own version of customized Xfce had solved this problem long before Zorin 16’s release.Other users of Zorin Lite complain that the lite version is not so light yet it has been performing very well on a 6-year old middle-of-the-run setup turning increasingly to low-end by today standards. Software selection is satisfactory. My sole objection concerns “Parole” as default video player. It cannot provide accurate seeking with large video files encoded with h264 or h265 codecs. Albeit a member of the Xfce family of apps, other Xfce-based distros justifiably skip it. MPV or VLC would be excellent.The major problem Zorin developers have to address but not specific to the Lite edition is their excessively slow release cycle. With the latest Ubuntu LTS released a year ago and every major Xfce-based distro out there already migrated or migrating to latest and greatest Xfce 4.18, the development of new Zorin lags markedly behind."

I've always been looking for a well-thought-out, stable, day-to-day usable Linux distribution, Zorin OS is exactly that. I have made some adjustments and use, for example, Synaptic, Vokoscreen, ClipIt, digikam, Telegram desktop, VLC, KeePassXC, Timeshift, Stacer etc. which are not installed by default.Then I have installed deepin icone theme and I use dark theme. But this is also the case with Linux, you have many customization possibilities, yes almost endless possibilities. You install roughly what you want, adapt what you want and use it how you want. Zorin is significantly simpler and less complex than windows. So are you looking for a flawless free operating system that works every day? then install Zorin OS."

But if you're not worried about that perhaps you're not aware or you simply don't care?I encourage people to read their Privacy Policy.That aside, Zorin OS standard, and only, install is just packed with too much stuff out of the box.Both GNOME and XFCE edition feels very heavy. As a result, the performance just isn't there.If you want to steer from the built in theme options expect some issues.With Flatpak and Snap available expect some inconsistencies amongst the app lands. Pick one or the other and make it simple for beginners as you boast who you cater to.To me, this feels extremely cobbled. More isn't always better."
1378,2023-04-11, Zorin OS, 16.2,10,1,"Zorin OS 16.2 is an excellent operating system that offers a user-friendly interface and a wide range of features. It is based on Ubuntu and comes with a lot of pre-installed software that makes it easy to get started with your work or entertainment needs. The desktop environment is sleek and modern, and the overall design is very polished. Zorin OS 16.2 is also very stable and reliable, making it a great choice for anyone who wants a hassle-free computing experience. I recommend this system to everyone."

The care that the development team took in this interface was exemplary, always attentive to details (icons, buttons, options, the system as a whole is very concise and beautiful, even in an XFCE for modest PCs). Another extremely positive point is the perfect integration with Windows apps through a good wine implementation. Undoubtedly, Zorin Os is the right distribution for anyone looking for a definitive migration from Windows to the Linux world!"

Ubuntu has lot of support through packages and lot of community help with troubleshooting issues. I started with Old Pc with very old hardware and upgraded from Puppy Linux to lite versions of Ubuntu.I have even tried Mint for a while ,which I like being minimalistic but getting the job done. I was looking for something where I wanted to spend less time on the command line and have it integrated well into the desktop experience, therefore gave Zorin an try. It is snappy, aesthetically good and lot of support for packages. Zorin connect is a good feature to have.I hope this OS continues to be supported and stay around for long and would like to see it grow."
1381,2023-03-16, Zorin OS, 16.2,10,0,"My experience is the following. For more than 20 years that I have known Linux, I have tried to move and put aside the Adobe applications, MS Office, Macromedia, Corel, Cubase, Ezdrummer, and an endless number of small applications that I used to develop my work.My first step was to start using Freeware applications instead of all the pirated software I was using, portable versions of things like Photoshop, installing GIMP and Krita as an alternative, etc. In short, I was first replacing the Software.Just this year I decided to move completely and my choice was Zorin OS core for which I bought a specific SSD in case of anything.I've been using the OS for a couple of months now and the truth is that it's wonderful, stable, light, fast, usable, as well as a very polished and beautiful aspect. The console used it very little.To be honest, it is a Distro that for people who develop in product environments, be it design, editing, music or in any other environment that needs an OS that works immediately and start working, this is one of the best alternatives. especially for its light environment by default, a real delight."

But there are problems that cannot be reported! as there seems to be no bug report page or contact! and their forum doesn't work! I have tried to write in their forum about my technical problems but the first post is never approved! so i gave up. Tragic when you see how good this distribution is.If I will use this distribution again! hard to say, in any case they must be significantly better at support in the future. Their Facebook page is very poorly updated, the forum seems to have major technical problems! and no place to report bugs!"

Years ago I actually enjoyed spending hours settings things but nowadays I want something very simple, something I can get running as quickly as possible. The fact that I am maintaining half-a-dozen computers makes ease of setup a priority to me.Anyway, with Zorin I can get a system up and running exactly to my liking from install to completion in less than an hour. I have been using it for a month and haven’t had a single issue in all that time. Of course,  not everyone will be using the same programs etc. that I have selected but you should  give it a try if you are looking for something that is simple to setup. I really can’t put myself in a noobie shoes but I think anyone with a minimal amount of experience installing operating systems won’t have any trouble using Zorin"

Anyway it was very easy to do it thanks to the instructions that guide you through the process.The software store is very complete and has everything I need, just a click away.As for games, thanks to Steam the offer has improved substantially. Also, through Lutris I have been able to install two Blizzard games, which are not available for Linux.The Zorin Os website is very complete to provide the necessary help. There is also the community that is always ready to help, especially the newbies.In my case, I have installed Zorin Os Pro, as a way to support the project, and I receive support from the developers.In summary, I am very happy with Zorin Os, I don't have to suffer from telemetry, unwanted advertising or being forced to try to impose programs that I am not interested in."
1386,2023-02-04, Zorin OS, 16.2,4,0,"Good Ubuntu Linux distro but there are quite a few bugs and is quite slow compared to faster distros like Ubuntu Budgie. Some bugs include how the ""Authentication required"" popup for the keyring keeps on popping up even if I input my password, running ""howdy"" for password facial recognition does not work well as often time the face detection ""times out"", when I open the lock screen it goes back to the lock screen and so each time I have to open the lock screen twice which takes a lot of time from me just to get to the app I want to use, sometimes when I have a search app running the entire computer would freeze and the icon images would disappear and so I would have to restart the computer and lose my unsaved work from apps like Xournal++, and I uninstalled the built in python3 accidentally and it also uninstalled the gnome desktop packages also (Ubuntu Budgie does not have a built in python) and thus my entire computer crashed and would only be in TTY mode so I had to switch distros on my computer. The pros of this OS is how there seems to be a large community of Zorin users, it runs on Ubuntu which supports a lot of apps I run like Matlab and Miniconda, and is quite better than Windows and Mac with ease of use and great Linux specific software to use like Libre Office and the Lutris game engine. Overall though, I would not recommend this distro and in fact would recommend people not to use this distro until the bugs I mentioned are fixed. "
1387,2023-01-30, Zorin OS, 16.2,10,7,Switched to Linux from Windows. I chose Zorin OS because of its good looking Interface. I love it. Would never want to use Windows again. I love that you can easily customize it and the Zorin Connect App works super well. I really enjoy using my Smartphone to controll my PC. It is super cool to see how good the performance is compared to Windows. ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ
1388,2023-01-15, Zorin OS, 16.2,9,9,"I've been using Zorin OS for a while now and I have to say, I'm really impressed. The user interface is sleek and easy to navigate, making it perfect for both Linux beginners and experienced users. The GNOME desktop environment is a great choice and it's inherited all the powerful features of Ubuntu.One of the things I love about Zorin OS is how lightweight it is. My computer runs smoothly and quickly, even with multiple windows and applications open. The ability to run Windows applications on Zorin OS is a huge plus and makes the transition from Windows to Linux much easier.One of the standout features of Zorin OS for me is the Zorin Connect app. This app allows you to easily sync your android phone's notifications with Zorin OS, browse photos from your phone, reply to text messages and share files and web links between your computer and phone. Unfortunately, I have an IOS device and I couldn't test this feature, but it's a great option for android users.For tech-savvy Linux users, Zorin OS is a great choice. It's based on Ubuntu, so it's stable and reliable, and it has a wide range of software available. The terminal is fully functional and you can run commands and scripts easily. Additionally, you can customize the look and feel of Zorin OS with the built-in customization options.Overall, I highly recommend Zorin OS to anyone looking for a powerful, easy-to-use, and attractive Linux distro. It's perfect for those new to Linux as well as seasoned users, and it has a lot of features that make it stand out in the crowded Linux distro market."
1389,2023-01-06, Zorin OS, 16.2,7,8,"Attractive is about the best to describe this distro. Most distros are basically all stirred with the same stuff only dressed up a little differently. Many offer at least a couple if not more desktop environments. That's really all that changes in these over kill of distro choices. Everyone has got to make their own rather than just customizing a few distros. Yeah, choice is great except when it's far too many and cannibalizes the whole ideal of choice. After trying a few distros, you discover they all start looking like the same recipe only the ingredients are added in a different order. Why rebuild a house when you can just throw a different color on the outside and rearrange the furniture? Distros sort of happen this way, and it's too bad because if we had more people working a fewer distros' things would actually work better and advance the platform sooner. But I never see that happening, all I see if more distros and more fragmentation doing no good to a decent OS desktop platform. "
1390,2023-01-05, Zorin OS, 16.2,9,4,"I like it !!I only give it a 9 because (so far) it does not seem to have the ""SUSPEND"" or ""SLEEP"" options for shutting down in such a way that it can be brought up again quickly.On the plus side, it has Libre Office built in, and the option to install ""Only Office."" I feel that one of these is critical as so many of us are used to the expensive office, and so most of us need something like thatPlus number 2 - one can choose from several common browsers. I have nothing against Firefox except that it doesn't work the way I, personally, am used to.So far, the only negative I've found is that when I did a ""search"" for CALENDAR, one came up, but I still don't know how to set up a shortcut to it.I am expecting a cheap laptop soon which will probably not have an OS on it, and I am NOT going to put out the big bucks for the common one most people use, when I can have a clean, simple, trustworthy version of Linux for FREE.The two ultra light distros I tried do not have the features I think I will need, so it looks like Zorin may be the best bet.This is not an easy decision as there are several great distros out there."
1391,2022-12-22, Zorin OS, 16.2,9,6,"I am using Linux on and off for 25 years. I tried multiple times to completely abolish Windows (later MacOS), but I always fell back into the professional arms of Microsoft (later Apple).But after installing Zorin Pro on an old MacBookPro 7,1 , I switched to Zorin on all my older Macs and now all but one of my Computers run on Zorin (or Pop!).With Zorin I could keep the look and feel of my Macs and use a modern OS, regardless the age of my systems. It just works and it performs better than MacOS."
1392,2022-12-19, Zorin OS, 16.2,9,0,"This is a gorgeous distro; the screenshot doesn't do it justice. And if you run the Lite version you get the single best implementation of xfce I've seen anywhere.This may be the single best distribution for Windows users coming over from the dark side. Not only is the interface and workflow familiar but you can even run (some) Windows programs via the highly integrated Wine infrastructure. Audacious!All in all, this is a quite impressive effort and one that I come back to frequently, even though I don't personally have (or want) any Windows connection to my OS. "
1393,2022-12-04, Zorin OS, 16.2,10,0,"In my opinion, after having tried various Linux distributions, and I'm not an expert on these platforms, because I've always used Windows, Zorin is the best distribution for those of us who don't understand anything about Linux. Easy to install, easy to configure, and easy to use. I recommend it to all Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 users who don't want to install Windows 10, try ZorinOS, you'll love it just like me. Or for users who have a team of more than 10 years, that Zorin is the best distribution and easier than the others. It would have to be ranked 1 for ease and speed."
1394,2022-12-03, Zorin OS, 16.2,10,1,"I tried this distro in its Lite version on my 2010's Lenovo C200 and I was satisfied with it: all the applications worked very well, XFCE desktop was eye-candy (in my opinion, it is the best distro equipped with XFCE I have ever used before!) and RAM consumption by idle was really low (about 510/520 MB) such as Linux Mint 21 MATE which I usually use as primary OS. I also loved Flatpak support out-of-box, even though not all the packages worked properly maybe because of my PC's age. Really recommended distro both for beginners and experienced GNU/Linux users!"
1395,2022-11-22, Zorin OS, 16.2,9,7,"I've been using linux for at least 6 years, i started with ubuntu, then moved to mint, then to ubuntu mate, then KDE neon, back to mint and recently tried Zorin. Even though i've distro-hopped a few times I am by no means an expert, although the main reason I distro-hopped was to find an OS with a clean and beautiful interface without imposing too many limitations (elementary cough cough) and which would allow me to be as productive as possible.  I used KDE neon but I was not happy with the vanilla theme that came out of the box, I customized so much I ended up breaking the OS lol, I stuck with KDE for 3 years.  I switched to mint cinnamon which was nice but the interface always left me wanting to change things, so I customized it and still didn't like what I ended up with.  Then I switched to Zorin and OMG, what a difference!  I no longer have to spend hours trying to customize the interface to try to make it look the way i want.  The icons look great right out of the box, fonts are gorgeous, theming is amazing! I have not had o do much to the desktop environment to get going the way I like it.  I know more experienced users love arch, live and die by it but for me Zorin is gorgeous and works for my purposes.  I totally recommend it!"

1397,2022-11-03, Zorin OS, 16.2,10,8,"I am in the process of migrating to Linux after 40 years as a Windows and Mac user. My many systems include an iMac, several MacBooks, and a half-dozen P51, P52, and X1 Extreme Thinkpads. I've more or less settled on Zorin OS Pro after distro-hopping between it, Ubuntu, Fedora 36, and several others. Zorin strikes me as a very user-friendly OS that allows me to be productive immediately without a lot of wasted time and effort, which is what I am looking for. I'll leave the experimenting up to those with more time to burn than I can afford.I opted to pay the $39 for Zorin Pro for the extra functionality, installed software apps, and the knowledge that I'm not missing out on any Zorin features. In my opinion, it's a small price to pay. My use case is one of a software and app user; i.e., I create content such as photos and documents, send and receive emails, manage investments, consume multimedia, etc. I don't play any video games or do any software development.Software availability in Zorin is excellent, and I find the software store to be well-stocked with FOSS apps. Also, many of the more specialized apps I use are web-based and are thus independent of the OS -- i.e., they work equally well with Linux, Windows, or MacOS, so the fact I'm using Linux is irrelevant in those cases.Installation of Zorin is made very simple and easy with its graphical interface, which is great because I'm still learning basic terminal commands. However, I can see that it will be very useful in the long run if I learn to use the terminal. In a way, it reminds me of the early pre-Windows days of computing and the need for a good knowledge of DOS commands."
1398,2022-10-29, Zorin OS, 16.2,3,1,"Disappointed - from the description it was supposed to be a distro aimed at users looking for a smooth transition from Windows or Mac. I tried three versions of Zorin: Core failed to install the kernel, Light didn’t have the pre-built themes configured to mimic Windows or Mac, so I then paid for the Pro version. The latter would not recognize the Wi-Fi card and would not complete the installation since it couldn’t access the Internet. Zorin support responded quickly but wanted diagnostic details not easily provided from an incomplete installation. Working from Terminal to find a workaround for a failed installation defeats the promise of a seamless experience.Request for a refund was declined as I had already downloaded the Pro file. I would not recommend this distro, certainly not for the intended target audience seeking a smooth transition to Linux."
1399,2022-10-29, Zorin OS, 16.2,9,15,"I had been using 16.1 for the past year and have recently upgraded to 16.2. Zorin OS is based on Debian and Ubuntu LTS. This means it doesn't upgrade frequently. But when it does, in my experience, it has a smooth path to do a distribution upgrade just by using the software apps in Zorin. Zorin OS is an admirable attempt to make a Linux desktop distro that installs and works well for former Win 7, 8, and 10 users. I went deep into Zorin OS last year when I had two Japanese laptops that just couldn't upgrade to Win 11. After I backed up a huge amount of files and folders for my teaching at Google Classroom, book manuscripts, videos, audio, etc from the Win computers, I wiped an install Zorin core 16.0. And soon after I upgraded smoothly to 16.1 without any issues. Wiping Win 10 (which had bogged horribly down in MS update hell) lead to both the Sony laptop from 2011 and the Panasonic laptop from 2013 running like new computers. I did upgrade the onboard RAM to 8GB in both machines, but Win 10 had me wondering if I really needed 16GB. 8GB is plenty for comfortable computing and webbrowsing on Zorin. I think Zorin is misunderstood or perhaps not appreciated by some because some suspect it is too much of a mix of things. Consider, it is based on Debian and Ubuntu. Its desktop environment is a mashup of Gnome and XCFE. For software it fuses GNOME, Snap and Flatpak. This can lead to confusing situations where a user might install a DEB package and then also install the same program as a Snap. However, this is a minor issue (and you might find one version works better, or updates sooner). I have found it very helpful that three different package management methods are used (and integrated from the software management program) because, otherwise, some apps I just can't get or get to run on my computer. For example, it's surprising how difficult it has been to get the once-popular DVD authoring program, DEVEDENG, installed and running on Linux desktop distros. But I really need this program. I also run Anti-x and Xubuntu on other machines (and the Sony laptop is dual-boot with Zorin 16.2 and Anti-x), so I'm not exclusively locked into Zorin. However, Zorin is the OS is do most of my office work, online teaching, and eve home computing on. I highly recommend it for those shifting from Win 10 to Linux--people stuck in Win 10 ought to consider it. They have also recently improved capabilities to run Win apps on Zorin, so that is an added benefit--you can continue to use those legacy Win apps if you can't find Linux replacements.    "
1400,2022-10-28, Zorin OS, 16.2,6,2,"I'm reviewing version 16.2 pro.  Still finding bugs that have been not been fixed since the initial 16.0 release.  It's not horrible, but it's not great either.Although Zorin gives the user many options on how the distro desktop looks, it is still a dated distro with lots of things that can break.  Zorin still has issues with Nvidia video cards.  I was finally able to get the Nvidia drivers loaded, but it took awhile and a few tries.  I ended up watching a YouTube video several years old to get a clue on how to load them.It can look good, but a distro needs to be more than just ""looks good"".  It needs to be reliable, and not subject to breakage from all of its extensions.Zorin is not a distro that I could recommend to others."
1401,2022-10-25, Zorin OS, 16.1,1,1,"Ummm... this is a bloated mess. There is nothing streamlined about this distribution. Seems more attention has been placed on looks rather experience and performance. This is so slow and jenky it's painful. Spent the first hour going through all the prepackaged junk and removing it. Only to have it crash trying to remove an application. After reboot, there were issues with the interface. I was surprised how temperamental this distribution is. And it's for beginners?Sorry but this is a very hard pass for me. Highly NOT recommended. "
1402,2022-10-18, Zorin OS, 16.1,7,5,"Takes too long to update... when it releases a new version, almost two years have passed, even Ubuntu isn't that slow. Now they created a version based on Ubuntu 20.04 while 22.04 is already there... When they decide to create a version based on 22.04, Ubuntu 24.04 would be already released for months.The same issue applies to ElementaryOS. If you don't like to live in the past, you enjoy having access to latest technologies of the market, then Zorin is not for you. It never releases a version at the same time of Ubuntu's, it takes more than 1 year to update itself so when they did, it's too late, they're closer to Debian stable than Ubuntu's."
1403,2022-10-13, Zorin OS, 16.1,6,1,"Installed and used Zorin fo rover a month on a computer for my neighbor kid. I have 15 years experience as Linux user and distro hopper. On the surface looks good, but alas there are snap and flatpak package installed by default. If removed something needs fixed. Very stable if your carefult but there are still missing items. Hdmi sound would not work out of box install pulse(not installed by default) and conflicted with alsa items and other multimedia programs. Start Over new install and removed most also and many snap packages imediated and rethemed. I cound of done the same things with a new installed of x ubuntu or debian 11.4 xcfe.  Was really a deal break, not recommened for new linux users.  Needs more work before claims of Windows replacement out of box."
1404,2022-09-28, Zorin OS, 16.1,10,23,"I've tried many distributions, but Zorin worked right out of the box better than expected. Any issues that arose from my own misdoings were easily corrected. This is by far my favorite distro to date and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and capable OS. I hope to see Zorin successful in helping people, companies, and institutions make the switch to open source software. The path they've taken with making Zorin familiar to Windows and Mac users will certainly help them be successful."
1405,2022-09-27, Zorin OS, 16.1,10,8,"After distrohopping for a long time, I found a distro which feels like home. Works like a charm, looks great, no snaps preinstalled. I removed the snap service, increased the swap size in my encrypted LVM, adapted some small settings and it simply works. After my opinion there is no need to go for the PRO version, but it is great to support them. If you come from Windows, you will appreciate all shortcuts your are used to use before. I have used Archlinux for a long time, but I never looked back."
1406,2022-09-26, Zorin OS, 16.1,10,6,"Very stable compared to other Ubuntu based versions like Pop Os. It is my daily operating system and I use web browsers like Edge, which in my experience, only Zorin works correctly. The same has happened to me with Steam and Proton, they work perfectly. I have returned to Zorin after using Pop Os for a long time and now I do not change it for anything. I use it daily to program, play and office. Many say that the UI is similar to Windows and that this distribution ""is perfect"" for those who come from there, Zorin OS is more than that. Zorin OS is currently working on a project called Zorin Grid, which is very useful for those of us who work with many networked computers."

1408,2022-09-15, Zorin OS, 16.1,10,14,"First, a little background:  I am a computer repair technician with 20+ experience, focusing on ease-of-use for the end-user.  As far as I'm concerned, if it's too complicated to use, there's no point in using it.  I've been an Ubuntu user since 6.06, and only recently began looking at other distros in earnest.  When I came across Zorin, I was immediately impressed by the layout: It was simple, yet reminiscent of Android.  You're given the option during your welcome tour to make it look Mac-Like, Windows-Like, or neither.  The dark theme is very pleasant, and everything feels like it's where it should be,While form is fantastic, functionality matters more.  I found Zorin to be both capable of being a solid workstation that's mindful of your workflow, while not getting in your way; a capable gaming OS with Steam, Lutris and Wine installs working well; and a fantastic, HTPC distro with much lower RAM requirements than other ""premium"" distros.Under the hood, it's Ubuntu, so users who are already comfortable with Debian-based distros can take off with Zorin immediately, but that's not where it shines...New users to Linux can also quickly grasp how to use and decorate the operating system.  So far, I've had ZERO calls for support on this OS.  I strongly suggest this distro for new Linux users, whether coming from Windows, Apple, or Android/ChromeOS.  While advanced users would benefit from a more robust entry, for example, MX w/ KDE, there is, in my opinion, no better distro to introduce new users to the world of Linux than Zorin Core.The only issues that I've encountered have been typical of Ubuntu based distros: limited 5G WiFi support, and no native way to span a single picture across multiple displays.Also, don't let the name fool you: Zorin Pro doesn't add anything to the mix as far as functionality.  It's a large assortment of hand-picked programs and themes aimed at ease-of-use, but its purchase helps to finance further development of the OS.They have a fantastic community, as well as a very helpful Telegram channel.

The experience was amazing and the installation process feels especially polished. The ideas behind this project are all the right ones in order to have newbies use and linux and for it to just work reliably. My favorite distro so far.I still had to move to another distro for my laptop as I don´t think the projet is quite mature enough for me to be able to rely on it. The way to do things is quite different from other debian-based distributions and some of them I couldn´t figure them out.I really hope that with time, more useful documentation will bring the whole thing together for users and that a swich to debian will make it even more simple and reliable."

My 11 year old could install without any help.I love the reliability and A-B root stability that I can be hands off for maintaining the system for the kids. I also love the auto update that will keep the system up to date. The greatest feature is the install from AUR, rpm, apk, flatpak, etc. Very easy to install any software that is needed. Kids love it. I tried playing around with it and it works great. The default desktop is GNOME. I will try to use MATE desktop that I like. Having the recommended 8GB memory really helps. The look and feel is comparable to MAC(IMO). very easy to use. Bottles and Wine works just fine."
1411,2023-04-01, Vanilla OS, 22.10-r7,8,11,"VanillaOS is a distribution that includes all of the fundamental applications that most people use, from browsers to codecs to software shops to offices to viewers and players. It also enables the user to download software from multiple package managers, which is then maintained in the Apx. Apx will allow you to construct a container based on your preferred distribution. You may make an Ubuntu (apt) container, which is the default, or you can make a container for Arch (pacman), Fedora (dnf), Alpine (apk), Void (xbps), and others. The Apx is typically a bit inconsistent, and it is still in its early stages, so I will assume that it will improve with time. I've tried it, and it hasn't worked a few times when installing some simple packages, and the integration between the appstore isn't seamless. Appimages run efficiently, programs run smoothly, the desktop environment consumes less than 1.1 to 1.2 GB of memory on launch, and the CPU usage is low. The installer also suggests extra packages for the user to install, which is a benefit. In terms of usability, it works and is easy; the installation is simple. VanillaOS also prioritizes security by incorporating features like firewalls and automated software upgrades. Overall, VanillaOS is an excellent choice for anyone seeking a simple, efficient, and safe operating system. As the project moves away from Ubuntu and toward Debian as its foundation, this operating system will improve over time. As a result, new users that transfer to Linux will have a nice selection and usability."

It uses an immutable file system which makes it very stable. Unlike other immutable linux distros, VanillaOS will not delete your installed packages after and update or and upgrade which is made possible by using the ABroot technology. This is where you can enter the transactional shell to install your core applications and modify your system. If you don't want application to modify you core system, you can yous apx instead which is the package manager for VanillaOS. Apx will allow you to create a container based on your distro preference. You can create and ubuntu container which is the default, or you can choose to create a container for (Archlinux, Fedora, Alpine, and Void."

1414,2023-01-27, Vanilla OS, 22.10-r3,9,4,"The benefit of Vanilla over Fedora is that is based on something that isn't afraid of shipping proprietary stuff, neither makes it hard for you to install it if necessary.The functional codecs, drivers are easy to use while on Fedora it makes so hard for you to install them and you never know if it's fully installed, I mean, you don't ever know if you have installed everything that should be installed until something breaks or stops working and you need to research why. It was the case with me using Fedora and the removal of necessary codecs like H. 264, H. 265, and VC-1 VA-API. This just makes Fedora more and more NOT suitable for the average Joe (as many Youtubers that have been probably paid to tell you that Fedora is as easy as Ubuntu is = fake news).Fedora is for devs only and people who has enough time to be mitigating stuff (not my case).Vanilla on the other hand tries to ship pure and vanilla GNOME under an Ubuntu powerful base. Well known for everyone! So, there's also the immutable part which makes it even more secure and less prominent to fails."
1415,2023-01-24, Vanilla OS, 22.10-r3,10,6,"Love this minimal distro and tried successfully on several machines including an old Lenovo Miix 320 tablet which runs nicely with Secure Boot enabled.Installation using the latest release version is quick and hassle free.  Memory usage is undemanding compared to Gnome on regular distros which helps if installing on low spec tricky hardware like Atom x5 devices.Apx is a bit hit and miss but does work.  Flatpak integration with Software Centre works great as does the Sub System containers for installing Fedora, Arch and Alpine pacakges. With no issues with Appimages either, Vanilla provides a lot of options in an efficient well presented immutable system.  Why all the negativity? This is a brilliant debut release so many thanks to the developers!"
1416,2023-01-18, Vanilla OS, 22.10-r3,1,0,"I've been following this project pretty much since the first public builds were available and back then it seemed interesting, a vanilla Gnome experience on a stable Ubuntu base with a unique flavour of toggleable immutability.Fast forward a few months and suddenly the project shifts focus to implementing seemingly as many possible distros into its apx ""package manager"" and completely changing up the immutability aspect to something more conventional. Following all those major changes, the distro release gets rushed in time for holidays despite not being quite ready.I honestly don't see what does this distro have to offer that Fedora Silverblue doesn't, which I believe is what the developer was using before and it clearly served as inspiration. I wish I could say the benefit is that it's Ubuntu based which some may prefer, but you barely get to interact with the Ubuntu aspect of it.Lets imagine for a moment that there is nothing to compare this distro to, how does it actually feel to use? Well, for starters the installer is fairly barebones, not even allowing for custom partitioning or dual booting, erasing the disk is the only option. The first setup experience is buggy at best, you can merely hope it will actually do what it says.Installing additional software can be confusing as apx might feel like a drop-in replacement for apt but it's more akin to a developer sandbox. Then there's the more common workflow for an immutable distro of installing Flatpaks and interacting with abroot for system packages. It's a hassle keeping track of what's installed where and what can even access the rest of your system.Vanilla OS presents itself as a deceptively simple distro when in reality it's only likely to be of any use to developers who can benefit from the container workflow and for that it might be better to just use one of the true and tried distros for now as this one merely provides a few convenient wrappers for existing tools like distrobox but it lacks the versatility and reliability."
1417,2023-01-14, Vanilla OS, 22.10-r3,3,0,"They could have just created pure gnome experience like what kde neon did with kde. But they made it too unstable by pulling so many strings at once e.g. a/b partition, apx etc etcThey sucked everything from ubuntu and made it pseudo fedora. Also this immutable thing has headaches of its own, It was a good project when it started but now its just a test bed for enthusiasts. I wot recommend this for daily driver as it's name itself suggests  it is 'vanilla'!If you want good immutable distro - silver blue is the answer.Also, their support is non existent and forum is filled with rude guys. So a 'bug is a feature' or 'developer hit by bus' is easy to come across."
1418,2023-01-07, Vanilla OS, 22.10-r3,8,7,"I was having a crash with R1 and R2 before even beginning the install, but R3 resolved this issue. Well, does this R3 look good. Really, best of all immutables for the looks. Works fast too. Install works like a breeze. The post-install takes care of the codecs, the Nvidia gpu, the office...This is so good. Printer HP is detected auto. Good.But like with all other immutables (Micro OS, Kinoite, Silverblue, Enless) you have to install VueScan to use the scanner. Not a big deal, but VueScan is commercial and or you pay, or you get a watermark. Actually, I do not like this. I payed for my driver when I bought my scanner, so...50 € for me is 50 €. Yearly then. So no, thank you. This is not Linux.So it would be great if hp-plugin is in the iso, actually. Or could be installed.But again, all immutables do not include hp-plugin.Another thing. Firefox. Vanilla includes a stripped down version of Firefox which is a shame. Impossible to install Firefox Extensions. Of course, Firefox is a Flatpak, but my Video Downloadhelper needs an extra plugin, which can not be installed in the flatpack version.Also tried to install yt-dlp with apx. A download of 500 MB with no result.yt-dlp does not work, but we have videodownloader in flatpak.So for the future...Include hp-plugin.Include the real full Firefox.So, yes, if you really look for an immutable, Vanilla OS is worth looking at. It is as good as Endless, but with the advantage of ABroot and apx. Only, I would recomment making a YouTube vid about using both ABroot and apx.Endless is second choice because you have less freedom here. But hey, with Endless comes...Firefox. So close call.Third is Silverblue-Kinoite for their lack of support for Nvidia.And forth is Micro OS as still in devellopment. Not that Micro OS is bad, far from. I used it with pleasure. Micro OS does not include Firefox which for me is a deal braker pur sang.But for me, Vanilla OS wins the competition now. Endless is another top choice."
1419,2023-01-04, Vanilla OS, 22.10-r1,1,0,"This OS sounded intriguing so I downloaded the ISO to give it a try. The live session ran OK in Virtualbox with no real issues. When I tried to install in Virtualbox, it would not allow me to configure the disk drive or even select it. I couldn't go any further.I don't have an available machine to try to install this on, so a VM is my only option. And, I didn't see anything on the web site or in the documentation about it not working in Virtualbox or any workarounds. Oh well, maybe next release will work better.Sorry."
1420,2023-01-02, Vanilla OS, 22.10-r1,10,3,"Excellent first experience with Vanilla OS. It's quick and simple to install, and had none of the glitches experienced by some other reviewers.  Runs smoothly and performs surprisingly fast on an old Celeron notebook. Perfect hardware detection and Flatpaks quickly installed.  Haven't tried using the containers as no need yet.Only thing to watch is that it caused Mageia on second SSD to become unbootable and no longer showing in boot menu.  Also use other immutable distros such as Fedora Silverblue and OpenSuse Micro OS. These are both fantastic, but Vanilla excels against them with setup speed and lightweight characteristics - plus far fewer updates to bother with from it's Ubuntu base! GNOME 43 makes it very easy to use and suitable for all users. The 'smart' updates run silently in the background at user defined schedules for convenience.Definitely a keeper and look forward to seeing how this new distro develops over time. Brilliant work and a refreshing spin on the masses of Ubuntu based distros."
1421,2023-01-02, Vanilla OS, 22.10-r1,1,3,"Nice concept.  But, definitely not ready.Initial installation seemed to be fine.  When the first setup was done, then rebooted, the choices for the set up were missing. Snap was already said to be not yet working.  Ok.  So, why was the chosen Flatpak install absent. No simple flatpak plug-in installed into the provided Gnome-Software manager as one would have expected,  Further, why was the offered LibreOffice missing when it was chosen for post install? If  one is to provide choices to be included within the OS post-install, why then deny the user those choices?  Why were they not installed as requested?Audio was also absent.  Since ""Almost"" seems to be nixed, there was no way to correct this issue.If a distribution bills itself to be based on Ubuntu, why doesn't it simply ""work out of the box""? It the distro bills itself as immutable, then shouldn't it detect one's current computer hardware and set it up such as it's base-namesake would?  Due to the inability to install the needed audio software on the system, or for the system to make allowances for such changes to be made, there was no way to correct this problem.  "

Choosing an other background is a poor facility.But de restrictions are unacceptable for daily use. Several times trying to install Libre Office - it was on the list for first install - was unsuccessful. The installer seemed to be working, but nothing appeared. Tried it on two laptops. Rebooting didn' t help.The number of usable applications is limited. No font installer; no pdf-viewer (use the browser), The simple browser refused to accept several websites/webapplications. Vice versa. Even Distrowatch was reported as untrusted.Some webplayers produced sound, but other webplayers kept silence.The philosophy and intentions are laudable, but I hope for more adaptibility and usability.I send this review, using an 8 year old laptop with Vanilla. More experimenting seems to be useful.

What a record.ABRoot is more than just a good concept, A/B partitioning is a breath of fresh air in the Linux world and a container based package manager to install packages from the main distributions like Arch Linux and Fedora is something I've always wanted and I can't believe we had to wait so long to see such a concept.As they announced, updates are not just automated, they are truly smart! This is by checking if the system can manage an update, by doing multiple checks like cpu, ram, connection.. again I can't believe we had to wait so long to see such a concept."

1427,2022-12-30, Vanilla OS, 22.10,7,6,"Of course, this is not a review, but more of a 'first impressions', as it only came out today. The first impressions where not so great. The installation program and first setup is amazing! But once that has completed, the system reboots and I wouldn't expect to still see the first setup wizard still there in the applications menu. I thought that it might still be there to allow users to make changes, but after running through the wizard again and changing a few options, I rebooted and found that nothing had changed, therefore making this program useless to users after first usage.The system is a breeze to use, responsive and elegant - I love the default light and dark themes / grub splash screen etc. they are so beautiful, but I cannot understand why 4 terminal emulators are installed: there is xterm, uxterm, gnome-terminal, and a new one called console too. This to me is a little too messy, and although they could easily be removed, they are unnecessary.I do have high hopes for this distro, and will continue using it for the time being.

i have used venom in a VM i did try installing on bare metal but for some reason the installer wouldn't pick up my partition like the VM did. Anyways, this review is about scratchpkg itself. I've adopted it as my package manager on a LFS install. I will say this is on par with kiss linux's package manager. I absolutely love it and how it functionss. I've been recommending it to everyone that I know that runs linux. The creator is very helpful and active but its on a telegram channel. The community is great as well"

I absolutely recommend trying venom, even if you just try it in a VM.

The project interested me, because it provided a source-based distro that was quick and easy to install. The installation can be done in +/- 10 to 15 minutes! The latest release of Venom is like a dream come true...a very minimal Openbox system that's just waiting for the user to customize it however they want. :) As I have used it over the last 2 years, I have realized that I have a love/hate relationship with it... What I love: source-based, easy to install, has its own package manager, the developer is super friendly and helpful, has a fantastic group on Telegram, and...it is free of systemd (if that matters to you). What I hate: What I hate is my own fault...not the fault of Venom Linux! I don't have the best hardware! LOL! My computer only has 4 GBs of RAM and 2 CPUs. Despite that issue, I still use Venom Linux, because it is such a fantastic and enjoyable system. The developer has done something amazing here, and I would highly recommend Venom LInux. If you want to try a source-based distro that you can install quickly and easily, try Venom Linux!!!

I find PopOS really nice to use every day. Of course it has things that could be better, like the pop shop and others... but, in general, a nice, quick and mostly reliable distro, easy to customize and to work with.It would be better if:- offered some way to rename the sound sources.- came with sound selector plugin by default (who has only 1 sound output this nowadays?)- had something to switch sound sources better than that.things appreciated:- great touchpad & gestures support- virtual desktop management- overall responsiveness"

For one thing the big issue for me is the Pop Shop constantly froze or simple quit after launching. You could not scroll through apps either. Apparently this has been an issue which seems to be ongoing. I also dislike that System 76 does not host a public forum for support for non System 76 hardware users. You find some help through Ubuntu forums but mostly it seems System 76 basically says use Pop OS at your own risk if you don't buy our hardware. System 76 does offer some general help troubleshooting with help articles. But not that specific to and certain hardware. Sort of frustrating for me as a rather green user of Linux so I went back to Ubuntu.I did not see much gained by using Pop OS since I had mostly a Intel vanilla setup for a desktop.

You should have the option to encrypt the disk as other distros do, MINT, MXLINUX, FEDORA, etc.  I really like the GNOME interface and really didnt want to get rid of it.

While the operating system itself is solid, I found the behavior of some of the developers to be immature and unprofessional. They often bring politics into Linux, which I found to be a turn-off.In conclusion, Pop!_OS is a decent operating system that offers a range of useful features and a modern user interface. However, the behavior of some of the developers can be a drawback for some users. Ultimately, it's up to individual users to decide whether the features of Pop!_OS outweigh any concerns they may have about the development team."
1446,2023-04-18, Pop!_OS, 22.04,10,0,"The best distro I have tried yet.  It lacks some customizability options, but makes up for with their modification to workspaces, launcher, and window tiling.  Beyond this it has all the conveniences we would expect from a Ubuntu based distro in terms of hardware compatibility.  Elementary OS has a slightly better front end, but that was it.  This distro is ultimately the best customization of Gnome and you can install it without worrying about the details because Pop OS already have figured it out for you.  While Pop OS is currently creating a rust based DE we might see this distro rapidly improve, or fade into irrelevance, so realize this exciting yet risky direction before you invest.  As for me - I'm all in!"
1447,2023-04-11, Pop!_OS, 22.04,10,0,"This is the best linux distro hands down. If you are running anything other than a debian distro dont read any further. For compatibility and stability coming from windows for the 10th time in my life to linux, this has everything out of the box. My install script shrunk to almost nothing just by switching from ubuntu to pop. Not to mention nvidia support out of the box, no confusing tutorials to leave you to decide which source/build of a singular driver that you need is built. It also comes with features that render many gnome extensions you would otherwise need in ubuntu compeletely useless. The pop shop for software is just amazing. I have __always__ used apt until meeting this fun little guy."
1448,2023-03-21, Pop!_OS, 22.04,7,6,"It's a solid distro and generally works pretty nicely, but it's more or less just Ubuntu with some nice quality of life improvements.I was coming from Ubuntu 22.04 with Regolith 2 on my work laptop, and Manjaro KDE on my home desktop.  I wanted something that felt a bit more fresh than Ubuntu, that gave me the option of a tiling set-up, and didn't require as regular updates and maintenance as Manjaro. Desktop is an i7-4790, NVIDIA GTX-1070 on an older (~2012) MSI board. I've used linux exclusively for ~7 years, but am not a sysadmin or IT professional - so tend to not want to spend a lot of time fiddling and getting things to work (though I'm usually willing to invest a little bit of time to  figure out some issues).I found Pop_OS! to be slightly frustrating for some things that were simple in both those other distros.  For example, it seems like the default Plex packages in Pop Shop are Flatpaks, and if you have a secondary HDD, it's a hassle to get Plex set-up properly with the correct permissions. For a 'plug and play' distro, I don't want to have to go through and manually set a bunch of permissions and fiddle around to get common apps to work well. I understand the motivation of flatpaks, but for a 'beginner friendly' distro they're a pain.  Out of the box, I had trouble with audio (I have a Scarlett 2i2 that acts as the main output), and the default video player wouldn't launch any of my media files (VLC worked fine when installed).  I haven't had any of these issues on Ubuntu 22.04 or Manjaro which are both plug and play for all my hardware. The Pop Shop itself was crashing very regularly.  I ended up using apt via CLI for everything rather than Pop shop, but you ultimately run into the same issue as Ubuntu - I ended up installing snapd on top of apt as an alternative to flatpaks, then you need to have a bunch of third party PPAs or download and install from tar to just get everything set-up.  I think I've just gotten too used to pacman and the AUR nowadays and find this type of package management experience very frustrating and convoluted.The tiling features are nice, but are missing what truly makes tiling WMs worthwhile - independent workspaces per screen/screen group (rather than changing the entire multi-monitor view for each workspace). I also had inconsistent performance with some UI features (e.g. occasionally couldn't access settings menu from the top-right context bar button).Overall, I felt like it was fairly comparable to Ubuntu 22.04, but has some nice default theming and extensions. I can definitely see the appeal, and it's a very solid alternative to Ubuntu, but I've switched back to Manjaro KDE for now. For my system and workflow, I can't see the benefit of Pop over Ubuntu - but it's still a very well made distro overall."

The weakest part of the distro is the Pop!_Shop, but when you're mostly just installing flatpaks in the command line anyway it's not much of an issue. Keep in mind that you can set Pop! to update itself; I feel safe doing this because System76 thoroughly tests their releases, and I haven't run into any big issues after many months of use."

I personally care about this because white color hurts my eyes, especially when you're sitting in front of a laptop for a long time.- Even though Pop!_OS uses X11, multitouch workspace gestures works on it.- It's easy to add Chinese/Japanese inputs.- It comes with Appindicator out of the box.- Flatpak enabled by default, no Snaps.- It's App Launcher is perfect.What I didn't like:- Fonts and orange color were ugly.- Pop!_Shop looks outdated, and it doesn't show extensions of some Flatpak apps. For example: you can install Fcitx 5, but it doesn't show which extensions it has, and without those extensions Fcitx 5 doesn't work properly. I like how Gnome Software handles this, and that kind of integration would make user experience better.- There isn't any application launch animation on Dock, an animation for indicating that an application being launched/clicked would be nice.Pop!_OS is the perfect choice for the ones that want to try Linux.

I learned how to remove, entirely, snapd, and accidentally discovered the tremendous temperature drop sans SNAP.I tried Mint and LMDE because they did not have SNAP but with Cinnamon I could not run my gnome extensions which I considered half the fun of wasting time on my laptop, so I went back to Ubuntu.

I sometimes think System 76 made changes just to make Pop OS stand out from the crowded Linux distros. Reminds me of how Ubuntu sort of went different directions as well, some good and some not so good. This is not just an issue with Pop OS, it is an issue with having so many distros and they all do things slightly different with no real uniformity. Can you imagine the mess if Windows had hundreds of slightly different takes on the original. Pop OS is probably as good as any other distro if you get used to how to interact with the OS. I had no issues installing it was very painless process and all the hardware worked. But it was the little annoyances using the OS that bugged too much to continue to use it.

It is a great system and well thought out but aimed at container workflows in the corporate world. The main issue for me was a couple programs I use will not work on it. I used Debian for many years and figured I would go back with no issues. I recently built a new desktop and went to load Debian on the second SSD and it was getting firmware errors not recognizing the Ethernet port so I downloaded the drivers and got them installed then was getting kernel errors; Debian is still on 5.10, opensuse was fine on 5.15 so I tried loading 5.15 and it loaded 6 stable and then had other issues I worked through and decided Debian was too far downlevel to put a bunch of bandaids on. I’ve been using Linux for 23+ years and tired of having to fix stuff all the time. I thought about Kubuntu and like it but don’t like snapd at all! I had Kubuntu running in a vm and left the only snap Firefox installed. I looked in the snap folder and it was almost 2GB in size and I wondered why? It looks like snapd not only installs programs similar to flatpak but it is also tied to many services as well, then I tried to de-install it all by following removal instructions which really does not remove it and the stuff you get uninstalled will get reinstalled on another update so Ubuntu is really trying to make sure it can’t be installed! (Huge red flag). The whole snap folder is read only and changing permissions does not work, snap has its tenacles all over the system doing god knows what just like systemd LOL. I had tried PopOS and always kept a kvm around and never had any issues to speak of so I installed it and it came up perfectly and recognized everything, I like their optimizations and glad they did away with the flappy desktop going in and out when you hit the super key, just stupid. I actually prefer plasma but use both and may try adding that and see what happens, past experience with adding plasma to an installed gnome setup resulted in some kde  apps bleeding over to gnome and gnome into kde which screws up some stuff but will see. Overall, very pleased with PopOS, it just works and very speedy on a fast system, I was kind of disappointed I did not have any bugs to fix, NOT! System76 keep up the great work!

I've been using GNU/Linux for 5+ years now, I'm quite familiar with it but up until recently I've been prone to distro-hopping (like many of you reading this, I reckon). I've tried dozens of distributions, and most of them felt okay-ish but incomplete when compared to PopOS. For instance, Arch linux is a good distro, it has a huge repository and great wiki, however you're pretty much left on your own once you encounter an issue. The ""elitist"" Arch community as they consider themselves are often just plain a**holes towards new users, or generally anyone who wants to learn something new/solve a problem. Not to mention how unstable it can be considering it's rolling release type of thing, so pretty much you can kiss your OS goodbye if something goes wrong during update (yeah, you can use snapshots but managing that and/or system crash when it occurs is just not practical). It's especially vulnerable if you haven't updated Arch in a while, so basically every time you update, you play russian roulette. I've tried Fedora, it's alright but not my cup of tea, OpenSUSE I consider an even better option, especially for system administration.What I love the most is the good old Debian and stuff based on it. I like stability and plenty of resources/packages if need be, plus it's one of the eldest linuxes out there so it's well supported and community is big. That why I love PopOs. It feels modern, stable, and very well designed. On top of that, it's using Gnome desktop which is very customizable and reliable. Just loving how things have been going on with this project, I surely hope it will stay like that. So if you're someone with needs like mine (Needs stable OS, good development team with big community, and lots of apps at the hand) then this is perfect for you. It's great for pretty much any task, whether it's daily casual usage, gaming, audio/video editing, pen-testing and ethical hacking (yeah those are an option too, you basically just need to add Kali's repo and install stuff you need)..Cheers!Miloš"

It's like an optimized Ubuntu, with all the benefits of that distribution (easy to use and great support) and without unnecessary software or visual effects. And it has a clean Mac OS look, running better than Elementary. I've read some criticism for leaving gnome, but the actual desktop works great."
1477,2022-10-19, Pop!_OS, 22.04,10,1,"I've been in the linux community for close to 20 years, and have tried 100's if not thousands of distros. This is by far my favorite one. Easy to install, Easy to use, and a clutter free desktop. Very good for gaming! Hmmmmm. 500 characters to submit a review seems really long but ok. Upgrades and making rescue disks is easy to do with pop os! Pop OS allowed me to break free from windows. Steam runs much better on linux then windows for many games! I highly recommend it. Give it a try and see for yourself."
1478,2022-10-02, Pop!_OS, 22.04,10,7,"I'm a new linux user and I've tried a good amount of distros (Fedora, Ubuntu, Manjaro, Zorin OS) but by far my favorite is Pop OS. I love the simplicity of it, I love the layout of it, I love the COSMIC Desktop, there's just so many great things about it and I don't plan to move away from it anytime soon. Since it's based on Ubuntu, there's already a lot of information out there that applies to Pop OS. The Pop Shop is great and has pretty much everything you would need, in a nice clean interface. I barely need to use the command line to install things since the Pop Shop already has almost all the things I want. I also love the launcher so that when you press the super key, a search prompt comes up similar to Mac OS Spotlight where you can just type in what you want, press enter, and it'll open it for you. It's a really quick, easy, and efficient way to open programs, especially for a fast typer like me. I also really like the built in dock since I've always found opening applications in stock gnome to be weird without using Gnome Extensions. I also have a NVIDIA graphics card but Pop OS makes it really easy to work with since I can just download an ISO with all the NVIDIA drivers preinstalled for me so I don't have to do anything to get it to work, which is very convenient. "
1479,2022-09-19, Pop!_OS, 22.04,7,0,"Too bad that they moved away from Gnome desktop. This was my go to distribution for Gnome. I also liked the features they added to the desktop experience. However, their move to Cosmic was a bog disappointment and the workflow now resembles more that of KDE, which for me does not work at all. So a pitty that they decided to develop their own desktop instead of contributing to upstream Gnome. Maybe in the future when Cosmic is a fully rewritten desktop environment in rust I give it another try.  "
1480,2022-09-12, Pop!_OS, 22.04,10,3,"- Its interface is very versatile, light, fast and at the same time modern.- The best thing it has is the tile windows- Excellent hardware utilization and power efficiency, crystal sharp fonts, and additional desktop environment features that alleviate GNOME anti-desktop designs, there are a couple of more things I like to point out when compared to other Linux distributions- I was able to install development tools very easily.highly recommended.It works for both basic and advanced users."
1481,2022-08-13, Pop!_OS, 22.04,8,8,"I can see why Pop!_OS has been trending on top 10 Linux distributions for the past year, excellent hardware utilization and power efficiency, crystal sharp fonts, and additional desktop environment features that alleviate GNOME anti-desktop designs, there are a couple of more things I like to point out when compared to other Linux distributions:1. Audio: Even though Fedora or Arch Linux (optional) uses the latest Linux audio software implementation PipeWire, they sound terrible, Pop!_OS uses PulseAudio and yet it beats PipeWire by 3 years ahead, sound stage is amazing, sound objects separation are super clear, overall on par with Windows, NO other Linux distribution could surpass Pop!_OS in this aspect! I repeat, NO other Linux distribution could surpass Pop!_OS in this aspect. (Debian, Arch Linux, Fedora, OpenSUSE and Ubuntu, basically all major Linux distribution out there.)2. Hardware Acceleration: Everyone knows hardware acceleration on Linux out of the box is a joke, almost all Linux distributions consume huge chunk of CPU power when playing videos, opening apps or simply web browsing If not manually configured properly, but not Pop!_OS, does exactly what it should just like Windows, out of the box. Does Fedora have that? no. Debian? no. Not even Ubuntu has that even though Pop!_OS is based on it.3. User Interface: User interface is very clear, the fonts are super sharp, again, all other major Linux distributions out there look terrible, blurry, especially for Qt apps. (Yes I'm talking about Fedora) Except for those that have KDE by default, or SolusOS.Now why Pop!_OS deserve 8 out of 10?Partially because of the name of the distribution has an exclamation point and an underscore, and I preferred vanilla GNOME, the developers should just add additional features that mitigate GNOME anti-desktop designs without changing the interface. Also, after years of using Linux on and off with open source software, I came to a realization, and chose to stick with Windows with free or paid closed source software, which I'm not gonna elaborate here. I installed Pop!_OS only on out of date hardware that no longer runs Windows well.One more thing, people should ask themselves why Android is more popular than GNU/Linux, both based on the Linux kernel and both are open source, and yet GNU/Linux is struggling to gain market in the desktop race. And I have a really unpopular opinion that Google's Fuchsia OS will become more popular than GNU/Linux if Linux distribution developers keep ignoring what made Android successful in the first place."
1482,2022-08-05, Pop!_OS, 22.04,10,5,"I use pop!_os as my daily operating system and I am fully satisfied with its performance.I cannot speak to the Nvidia drivers and the related issues mentioned under a few reviews below as I do not have one.What makes pop!_os one of the best distros are:1. Ease of installation and use;2. Can be used by beginners and advances Linux users to accomplish tasks;3. Combines the stability of Debian and relatively the most updated applications adopted by distributions like Arch;4. Does not adopt the Ubuntu direction of imposing snaps even though it is based on Ubuntu;5. Has its own desktop environment that is expected to be even better when fully developed using Rust;6. Is backed by System 76. This can also be a drawback if System 76 decide to go the same Ubuntu direction;7. Rolls back the updates to previous releases;8 and many more.......A few things pop!_os may need to improve:1. Giving the user the option to select Ext4 or BTRFS during the installation;2. A server version even though it is not needed as Ubuntu shines in this area.Overall, pop!_os is a great distribution thanks to its team. It can be even better if combined with the hardware provided by System 76."

I installed pop-os on both my laptop and office desktop. Occasionally have some issue with input method while using Chrome browser. Occasionally have the fan running fast on laptop, but quiet for the most of the time.One thing I like pop-os is that it has built-in nvidia graphic card driver, and user does not need to worry about it. I wonder whether system76 is going to release a pop-os server version without desktop environment. And this could be useful for people doing scientific computing or other services, because the desktop environment occupies a lot of GPU ram. Or is it really necessary that one may consider ubuntu server? "

In this version of Kodachi Secure OS you get a great Dashboard that controls all networking functions including VPN,TOR, and DNS along with kill switches alarms and properties! The reason I am giving this version an 8 i! instead of the 9 or 10 it deserves is the Dashboard has to be moved to a lower work space instead of minimizing it! It needs to be running in order to hear the vulnerabilities of dropped VPN or DNS servers!!! Kodachi Still comes packet with all of the software one would need to make this OS a Everyday Operating System! The work flow is quite Easy to learn with little practice as it is intuitive! Can Be Run From Memory Off Of A Simple Flash Drive Or Use a Tool Like Ven-Toy! Or As I Have Been Doing To My NVME SSD! If Install and Encrypted On Hardware Kodachi Has A Nuke Option That Can Be Found In The Extra Tools Tab On The Bottom Dock!  After Start Up Open Up The Dashboard Located On The 1st Tab Of The Bottom Dock And Have  Fun!!!! I use the Cold Dark theme which can be downloaded from xfcelook.org and copied as root user to ""/usr/share/themes/""\I also download the BeautyLine Icon Pack and copy it as root to ""/usr/share/icons/""And Lastly Use the Bibata-Rainbow-Original Cursor pac and copy it to that same Icon Folder ""/usr/share/icons/"" Then You Must Open Settings/Appearance From The Dock Under System Settings And Choose The Themes, Including Window Manager Then Open Up Mouse Settings/Themes and choose my cursor! But That Is The Beauty Of Linux XFCE Is There Are Tons Of Themes To Choose From Already!

I came to Kodachi Secure OS from Windows with little or no knowledge of the Linux kernal! I resisted moving to Win11 because I have 100's of old games and software I would run on Win7! but with Windows becoming spyware I did not feel safe running those old apps! So if I am giving up my Old apps I needed to learn what is out there to replace them that is open source and most of all FREE! The developer has done a great job in assembeling the most frequently used open source software that one might need to have on their system to make it usable daily! There is also a tutorial video on how to use Kodachi to remain secure online! I really loved that Kodachi has support for several VPN's out of the gate! I use NORD myself since I have never found a free VPN that is Worth anything! They Scare me since I don't know who is looking at my DATA! The layout of the Dock and the Desktop are condusive to a productive work flow! I have tried other distro's but settled on this one because of the Dock, Dashboard, and the support for NORD. I installed it to my hardware but it can be run from a USB flashdrive or even a disk without modifying you systems harddrive at all! Give Kodachi Secure Operating System a try! There is a new version on its way built on Debian! So keep your eyes open to catch all of the GREAT Releases from the Kodachi team!  KvnLSms"

I wished Warith would revert back to a more reliable version. havent tried Tails, but Parrot seems very substantive in all areas of security and privacy. Kodachi promises so much in its user interface and i used to think it was the only distro i needed but to has many bugs so only 5 out of 10."

1492,2022-06-20, Linux Kodachi, 8.23,9,85,"Much improved version for what this distro is (which appears not so much concerned with say preventing Symbiote malware as making it hard for websites and hackers to learn your IP in absence of virtualization).Still has a sysctl bug, in that even though you uncheck ""Enable IPv6"", ipv6 still leaks unless you enter ""sudo sysctl -p"" in terminal each session; further, the OS remains passwordless sudo, in a time where Linux-targeting malware is evolving into the realm of silent installs with little real time AV available to Linux.That's why I give this version a 9 instead of 10 for the hacker-frustrating distro this OS aims to be.That said, version 8.23 doesn't need UFW to deny incoming; in fact, if you try to activate gufw from menu or terminal it will lock up system). Out of the box, Kodachi 8.23 stealths all ports including internet port ""0""...again, without the user needing to touch gufw (as tested at Gibson's ""Shields Up!"").HWID randomization actually works in 8.23, as does IP source randomization. There are a number of tweaks and utilities available in the Dashboard and menus, but a user would have to familiarize themselves on how to use them; the developer has some YouTube-hosted videos on his OS, none new, but the gist remains the same; users have to otherwise know or research usages on their own.The limit of anonymization this OS offers appears to be a user using a VPN with the OS torrified, plus then opening the TOR browser and connecting to TOR via a bridge...placing the browser outside concerns of systemd/Postfix/et al direct giveaways (yet as always, time correlation attacks are possible).Silent install malware risks excepted, Kodachi 8.23 works for me for what I need...frustrate hackers, frustrate myriad ever-growing numbers of trackers that want to know or steal your every thought even while using the everyday internet for mundane purposes. This version seems a good option for those whose hardware cannot run virtualization (or Qubes or Whonix), and would otherwise have even less privacy."

1498,2022-04-21, Linux Kodachi, 8.17,9,5,"Great distribution, really great job!I must admit that I don't use it as a daily driver, but I started using it a couple of years ago when I still had to travel a lot for work, and sometimes I was in places where I wanted some privacy.The most positive aspect in my opinion is the ""educational"" one, with respect to privacy and related tools.It's been very nice to discover and learn more and more about privacy and security models; at that time I had never spent much time on VPN, TOR network, proxy chains, dns decrypting and so on. That was a fantastic learning!Sometimes I end up talking about privacy with inexperienced people, and I never fail to mention or quickly show Kodachi Linux, just to give a cue to better understand those aspects, inviting people to try get their hands on it.I have to admit that the fancy graphics and the complications of having to manage panels with a myriad of tools can be scary for those who are not familiar with these aspects.But here's the point: if your privacy needs are rather basic and your Linux (and IT in general) experience is basic, maybe something like Tails can be enough, it provides great results with a very easy out-of-the-box experience.But if you really care about privacy, either out of necessity or passion, it's worth diving into Kodachi Linux to get the most out of it.A positive note goes to the creator, in addition to his excellent work of course, for the fact that he is available on the Discord channel.

1500,2022-03-26, Linux Kodachi, 8.15,1,31,"I admit I was until recently a fan of this distro, but testing out what some other reviewers said, finding criticism well-founded, plus discovering some new information about how internet and vpn use is regulated in the developer's nation, I can no longer say this is at all a distro for casual web and app users' privacy or security.Indeed, there is GUFW, but it is out of the box disabled, with no warnings from the developer; though one unchecks ""Enable ipv6"" in Dashboard, then and after restarts every time one's ipv6 address is always visible to the web despite ipv4 becoming obfuscated as promised; gnunet and i2p are outdated modules, and it's not easy for casual users to know or update them; on first boot, per a 2020 Youtube Russian OSINT video at his channel, the developer states the OS writes to json your IP so he can check it for blacklisting...if you're blacklisted, you won't be able to ever connect to Kodachi vpn.At first boot, regardless of IP blacklisting or not, the OS further does an HWID hash of your device and sends it to the developer so he can ban you from Kodachi vpn (and perhaps further download of the OS); no contest with banning spammers, torrent abusers, and the like. But one has to realize that this OS and developer are in Oman and check laws there.Since 2010, vpn use has been heavily restricted in Oman; literally one has to have a business to apply for vpn use, and even then such business will be required to get and keep information on user identities and usage, required to forward same to the Telecommunications Regulatory Service; it's not just spam/crime that's banned and actionable in Oman, but if you criticize faith or the Royal family, or view sexually explicit material of any kind, or are the whistleblower type, or are an activist, likely you at least need to be watched if outside Oman. In any case, minimally, at first boot your HWID, IP and location are very likely going to be sent to cyber at trs dot gov dot om as TRS requires of all business licensees. Given the solid relationship Oman has with the US and UK governments, decide for yourself if you'd be comfortable with Oman watching your online moves.To me it seems intended or not, Kodachi OS is more in the nature of a honeypot, rather than oasis from, online surveillance; in the quest toward better privacy I'd suggest an OS such as Qubes or Whonix if your device can handle virtualization; if not, some like ParrotOS home edition have AnonSurf via Tor, a network manager with pre-configured openvpn you can easily enter your own free or paid vpn credentials into, plus it runs easily even on Pentium III dual cores."
1501,2022-03-17, Linux Kodachi, 8.15,1,13,"No wayland/xsandboxing, no boot peram hardening, no sysctl hardening, no trimmed down kernels, tons of bloat (2800 PACKAGES BASE?!?!?!), false and untrue security models (Tor + VPN + Torify + Tor DNS which isnt recommended by tor, can deanonymize you and breaks tors features while not making you secure at all). Recommends using vmware as virtualization software? The proprietary VMware?????. At best the OS is okay for using the free VPN and thats all, other than that you can count me and anyone truly in the know about security and anonymity out."
1502,2022-03-15, Linux Kodachi, 8.15,8,0,"Generally some really good ideas went into this distro, but I noticed a salient problem about anti-hacking/privacy violation potential in this version using a live non-persistent install. Of course I first went to the dashboard and did the usual things (torrify system, update timezone, change MAC, disable auto-login, etc, and especially uncheck ""enable ipv6""); turning on ""Kodachi Lite"" browser, even get a score of 100/100. But then, using the ""Security Check"" tab on ""Kodachi Lite"" browser, I noticed Fake Vision spotted vpn use, and worst of all the ""IP Check-Advanced"" clearly spotted my ipv6 address, ISP, and location...again, with ""Enable ipv6"" unchecked, and a score of 100/100. Kodachi appears to still use an OpenVPN 2.4 series client though the 2.5 has been in use by OpenVPN for two years, so some lines of code which could be added to OVPN's .conf file and shut off ipv6 won't work. Thus, the casual user should be aware that the only browser in Kodachi 8.15 which doesn't leak ipv6 and vpn use is the ""Kodachi Loaded"", regardless of ""Panic Room"" and ""VPN"" dashboard settings.

All network, speed, and other issues gone! It performs just like Warith describes. Like with any other privacy/anon OS or tool, research its tools and use it wisely and legitimately. Also, if you don't trust Kodachi's native vpn  you can also add credentials from any other vpn(s) you use; then there are no telemetries ala Windows back to the mother ship. In all, when properly run and on USB, Kodachi makes it more difficult for common hackers and trackers to do damage. Thanks for this privacy and security OS option, Mr. Maawali!"
1504,2022-02-15, Linux Kodachi, 8.15,10,31," Wow! When You Think This Distro Could Not Get Anybbetter Warrith Comes Through Again! This Version Has A Option To Randomize Your Hardware ID! I Guess Warrith Is Reponding To The Sniper Who Gave His Distro A 1 Rating Out Of 10!

Comes bundled with Libre Office and tons of other FREE and Open Source applications! Kill switches for VPN's, TOR, DNS, and your Security Score etc. Nuke option on encrypted HD setup so you can delete the encryption keys and wipe EVERYTHING! The ability to turn off the anonymous services so you can access your bank accounts or other sites that require you to show your REAL IP ADDRESS ! You can turn off all the radio signals and restrict it to the wired connection! You can spoof your time zone, select a random host name, fonts, icons, keyboard strokes! All of this that can be run without even installing Kodachi on your physical hardware ! It can be run from ram which makes it amazingly fast even on ancient hardware!Cons = The audio requires me to go to the settings tab every time I reboot and set it to my HDMI output.You can not change the user name if you want all of the security scripts to work !"

The NUKE option if installed on an encrypted drive is really neat! Do not be scared off by these snipers who want to decrease it's score! I've been using it since version 7.6 and have had no problems at all. In the dashboard you can change how receives the IP address info and customize the DNS providers, TOR ,VPN kill switches etc. XFCE desktop is super easy to customize and there are tons of themes to download!  It is laid out with productivity in mind! It comes with the most popular FOSS applications preinstalled so the package count is larger than a striped down OS! But if you are going to download and install them anyway why does that matter?"

The Kodachi Dashboard is just wonderful GUI with everything pre built at your fingertips but light weight same time... hard to explain.I didnt watch the instructional video and within minutes was able to set up and customize the pre installed NordVPN which was very intuitive. You can see alot of thinking has gone into this distro. The Desktop is clean but with useful Conky style data. No wasted data, all clear and concise. There is even a panic room GUI which has everything at your fingertips from daily use features to even emergency wipe etc.I am really thinkig of using this as my daily driver instead of Ubuntu now. Kodachi just feels so smooth and clean. There is all the programs I need like synaptic package manager etc and pre-built VPN and TOR and i2p features. Its hard to explain how good it is. Best try the live iso yourself first. I recommend this to all people who are looking for a fresh daily driver and or  those who also want access to security features at your fingertips.

I watched the very long instructional video at digi77.com! I Suggest skipping ahead to the 19 minute mark to learn about VPN's and how to configure your VPN connection! Then Skip forward to about 59 minute mark to learn about all of the Tor options. But if you have the time watch thee 2 hour long instructional video! It comes with great themes installed but the XFCE desktop can be tricked out to resemble any OS out there by simply going to the XFCE Eye Candy Website! The preinstalled programs make it possible to complete just about any work that you might need to do! From video editing, sharing files or just to keep notes! The Support for NORD VPN built into the system was also a big seller for me! I have tried other distro's but this is the only one I found that gives you multiple layers of security! With kill switches built into the dashboard that will protect you if for some reason your connection becomes compromised! I love that it can be tried without making any permanent changes to your system by running it from a live boot flash drive! Synaptic Package Manager lets you install countless additional programs along with Gdeb Package Manager you can install all the games or other apps you might desire if you are installing it onto the hardware! This Latest Distro's have an upgrade button in the about tab on the Security Dashboard! Thank You distrowatch! I Do Not See Myself Going Back To Windows or Mac OS Which in my opinion has become SPYWARE and in some cases Malware! But Yall Dont take my word for it! Download the ISO file and burn it to a flash-drive with your favorite program like Etcher or Rufus etc. and boot your PC from it!"

As always i want to install it in the hope booting will speed up. But the installer stops after the keyboard-choice. Also from the option Direct Install.Some distro 's shutdown in 2 seconds.

1530,2023-06-28, FreeBSD, 13-STABLE,9,19,"
I installed FreeBSD this spring, on two laptops, and it has turned out very well. I decided to go an unusual way to create the slices on the hard drives. Have a new 1TB Samsung disk on one computer, specifically for FreeBSD, but share the 500GB Samsung disk on the other computer with Linux systems. There, I went the route of opening Gparted in Linux and creating 5 swap partitions, of the size that fits well on FreeBSD. Then booted FreeBSD from a USB stick and started the installation. Selected the relevant swap partitions, for root /, /tmp, /usr, /var and swap. Used freebsd-ufs on the slices. The only downside to this method is that Gparted on Linux doesn't detect the ufs partitions afterwards. It can be easily fixed with wipefs in Linux and run it on the relevant partitions and change the partition-table signatures, so it conforms to FreeBSD [wipefs -o ""device signature""]. The signature for ""Linux Swap"" must be removed from the partitions. Takes no time in a Linux shell.After that, ufs appears normally in Linux. Then you can start in single user mode and install TRIM on the disk drives [tunefs].KDE5 works great on FreeBSD. Fine adjustments need to be made in several config files and after that everything works very well. Installed Tinyproxy and the Pf firewall. Both work well.It is well worth the time to install FreeBSD. Video, streaming, internet search, LaTex, LibreOffice, everything works very well.BSD Help pages are also generally very good. Chainboot (chainboot) from GRUB works fast and well [boot.efi].No specific cons, just questions about different settings to suit everyone. Thank you."
1531,2023-05-15, FreeBSD, 13-STABLE,8,6,"I installed FreeBSD 13.2 recently, with KDE5 desktop and UFS file system. I run it along three Debian systems,on Samsung Evo SSD (Thinkpad). It took a while to configure everything manually but the BSD documents are very good. It is stable and fast, so is the KDE5 and all the applications I have used, like Firefox and LibreOffice. For those who want to refresh their knowledge of Vi and config files, FreeBSD is great, everything is donemanually. When I first ran spectre-meltdown-checker, I got 10 CVE´s ""red"". By running the checker with --explainedI could eliminated the ""red"" by putting four lines in /etc/sysctl.conf.After that only two CVE´s are now red; CVE-2017-5753 and CVE-2018-3646. Everything else is now ""green"".For people interested in UNIX and UNIX-like systems, FreeBSD is a great choice. Grade 8/10."
1532,2023-05-09, FreeBSD, 13-STABLE,5,0,"I've used FreeBSD since version 7.* and here is my opinion on it's strengths and weaknesses.PROS:- Can be stable if deployed correctly and on the right hardware- Can be used effectively but excels at specific tasks rather than being a general computing platform- Freedom to use and deploy as you see fit- Administration via the FreeBSD tools is fairly straight forward and utilitarian- Has cleaner userland than GNU/Linux- Can be considered a more complete OS than most GNU/Linux distros from a design stand point *However this is debatable now a days if you consider usability being a factor when comparing to current GNU/Linux solutions.- It's not forked from multitudes of other sources like many of GNU/Linux distros areCONS:- Requires high amount of effort to lock down properly from it's original distributed form- Has limits in regards to scalability- You will encounter issues with no solutions in sight (spanning across months or years different versions/releases)- Documentation is outdated and often requires online research, this scales with your general knowledge of the system but can be an issue if time sensitive projects are at stake- Not a good daily OS for general purpose computing due to effort involved to get things done- Ports collection looks good on paper but compiling from source will quite often fail you and consume much of your time- Package versions are way behind in most cases- Development team is fairly small compared to most popular GNU/Linux solutions, this of course slows down it's development and its beginning to show these days- Getting support is not easy and can be a quick turn off depending on the type of user you are and what your expectations areIn practicality, to me it feels like FreeBSD has ran it's course now and is now a hobbyist platform for most part.If you have lots of time to burn and don't care about cutting edge developments you might be able to use it to fulfil some specific task but it won't be long before you feel like you are missing out on features that just aren't there and aren't coming any time soon.I still like it though :D"
1533,2023-04-17, FreeBSD, 13-STABLE,8,5,"I have the intention to make FreeBSD my second OS besides macOS and learn it. I have bought the book ""Absolute FreeBSD"" by Michael W. Lucas for this purpose.The main obstacle so far have been hardware support. On my Thinkpad T410i suspend/resume didn't work properly. When waking it up the screen was black. From what I have read this is because of some issue with the Nvidia driver, and there is no real solution.On my Lenovo Ideapad the wifi chip is not supported unfortunately.Because of these obstacles I have mainly evaluated the OS in a VM.The experience has been good this far, it works for the things I intend to do and want to use. There is more manual work involved setting up a desktop environment than in NetBSD or OpenBSD, but it's not hard and the documentation is excellent.To run FreeBSD on real hardware I'm going to buy a new PC. Thinkpads seems to be a safe bet.FreeBSD is a very good OS, I just wished to hardware support was a bit better, so I can't give it a rating of 10."
1534,2023-04-16, FreeBSD, 14-CURRENT,9,8,"Probably the best operating system I have used. Almost everything from Linux I used was packaged and maintained in the repositories (Sway, Librewolf, etc.), and it all worked flawlessly. The only big issue I had was that my audio was constantly crackling which (for me) made it almost unusable when using my motherboard's audio. Also the way programs will leave .core files everywhere is extremely annoying, I believe this is fixable, but I did not try it while I had it installed.9/10 simply because of the audio issue."
1535,2023-04-05, FreeBSD, 13-STABLE,8,6,"I have tried FreeBSD. The system itself has easy installation which lasts about up to two hours but it doesn't mean the system is easy to use and maintain (some knowledge about networking, unix and FreeBSD itself is necessary to use it without any problems, not to mention the basics of computer science). For people who are familiar with Linux for some time and have been doing most things manually, it shouldn't be hard to use FreeBSD.This system is mostly installed on servers, so it's worth mentioning that its goal is to provide good performance for these devices, which are security, stability, assured advanced network software, settings and capabilities. It's just perfect for servers. During installation we can choose to have UFS( Unix file system- like it says, it's provided by every unix system) and ZFS filesystem( the newer one). I can't say anything more about that because I have been using this system for almost a month and I'm just a simple Linux user, who didn't have to do many configurations.Some problems can also occur. The most serious one is lack of driver support(especially for laptops, but mostly it shouldn't after all. The most common problem is with wireless access. I heard about some problems with SSD support but my disk is HDD, so I can't say anything about that). Other problems with FreeBSD are not that bad and it can be fixed manually, but sometimes it needs to seek deeply to solve some problems.In conclusion, it is perfect for servers, can work on Laptops but not always, and using it wisely should make it one of the most helpful OS for work and ONLY work. Using this for other purposes is only pain with no gain."

Having ZFS be a first-class citizen, the clean separation of base and user software, and the great documentation make it a pleasure to use. I also like their Policy of Least Astonishment (no breaking change for the sake of change). Jails are also a step up from LXC in my opinion.It's not as easy to get going on a desktop/laptop as most Linux distros but it's still definitely usable, though you may have some pain points if trying to use newer hardware. It doesn't seem to be their focus, and that's fair."
1539,2022-11-15, FreeBSD, 13.1,5,0,"I’ve been using freebsd over the years but always ended back on Linux due to various incompatibility issues (I think the last version I used was 10.x). So thought I would give 13.x a go so I installed in a vm and used for 6 months and got everything set up to match my workflow in Linux with no issues. The current Linux distro I’m using announced they would be going to a container based workflow next year which fits their enterprise model and it is one of the best in my opinion but I tried a beta version and it’s ok but not really aimed at home users anymore so started looking around for a replacement. I build my own pc’s and know what to avoid with Linux so keep things simple and not using anything fancy but it is a ryzen 7, asus board, 64GB memory, 2 ssd’s, and 3 large data drives, no fancy video card, etc. I started going through the freebsd install and noted that it did not pick up the realtek Ethernet port or the wireless which Linux has never failed to pickup, I knew I would have to probably configure the wireless later but this is honestly the first time a *nix has never saw an Ethernet port and that Realtek port has been around for over 2 years. So I finished the install and did some searching and found a driver and downloaded it as well as the ‘pkg’ installer since it apparently is not part of the base install but pkg add is so used that. Then went to install the missing driver and it said missing signature file or something to that effect. I powered it off and came back to it later and when it booted was giving some other weird error that I had never seen before and would not even boot to a prompt so for the heck of it wiped it a tried again with the same exact result so thinking it is a kernel issue, tried searching but did not find anything that helped. I was hoping that freebsd would work out, was getting ready to send a nice donation their way but looks like I’ll be sticking with Linux and hope the upcoming 14.x will have better results. I think freebsd only works on minimum 5-7 year older hardware, too bad because I really like it and will continue to use in the kvm but really want to get it working on bare metal. "

I installed XFCE and all the software thatI use on Linux runs on FreeBSD. All my hardware was supported by FreeBSD ... so far so bad ...I installed the binary packages with pkg. But the binary package of LibreOffice comes without GTK integrationand PostgreSQL drivers. I need both for my daily work. So I compiled LibreOffice from ports.Afterwards I locked LibreOffice and most of its dependencies. I never updated ports afterwards.After installing the quarterly updates with pkg upgrade LibreOffice didn't start anymore becausesome libraries were updated which LibreOffice depends on. So I had to update ports and recompileLibreOffice. This took 7 hours on my notebook.I also installed FreeBSD 13.1 in a VM. After installing the quaterly updates via pkg upgrade, I couldn't startXFCE anymore because lightdm was broken and I wasn't able to get it working, again.Conclusions:Pro:- Fast and stable os unless you install updates- a lot of software available - good hardware supportCons:- very hard to install and configure- binary package of LibreOffice comes without GTK integration and PostgreSQL-Drivers- LibreOffice from ports has to be recompiled at least every 3 months (takes about 7 hours)- High risk that quaterly updates make the system unusableNot mature and stable enough to use as a Desktop OS for daily work."

It's a lot easier to manage and ZFS is pretty awesome.  I have no problem recommending this OS.  Especially for servers.If you're going to use a desktop environment, my recommendation would be MATE.  In Linux, Gnome is pretty popular and MATE is a lightweight version of it.  It's a pretty painless install and works well.  As an alternative, use XFCE.  It works pretty well and is also a pretty quick install."

It is amazing how many packages are available. It takes some skill to set up and customize but much less work than in the past. I think version 14.0 can be a mainstream platform for desktops and laptops. I had no network or sound card issues, and the 1920 resolution worked without tinkering. I have been a long-time user of Solaris, but now I think FreeBSD will be my primary OS. The RC init easy to use compared to the nonsense that has become Linux systems. I think FreeBSD is more responsive than most of the LINUX OS I tried. I have never recommended an Operating System on Distrowatch, but I would recommend FreeBSD now after installing the latest version on my desktop system. I have always preferred UNIX for servers, but now I think it is 'now' ready for the desktop."

The forum is very active and full of helpful, nice people. I use this on 2 home servers and 3 desktop computers and it runs well and gets the job done. I haven’t noticed any crashes while using FreeBSD for a couple years and the stability is great. It feels a lot speedier and stable than Linux.you have tons of applications you can install to get so many jobs done, whether it’s for a server, regular use for internet browsing, reading email, watching videos, etc.Overall, I highly recommend FreeBSD- give it a try!"

I've got the full Kde/Plasma environment installed and all looks very neat and works fast and perfectly.Another plus of the FreeBSD is that you can install whatever on it, like more DE's and when you remove it (Delete followed by Autoremove) no crap is left behind, this in contrast with whatever linux-distros.I was a linux user for over  years, from which the last few years 'plain' Arch, but I'm very satisfied with FreeBSD and use it now as my main OS."

Much to my surprise everything worked.For servers FreeBSD's stability and the ZFS filesystem can't be beat.  I also find administration straightforward and documentation excellent.  I'm sure having the kernel and core utilities developed together helps.Bug fixes come in maybe once a month, a much smaller volume than Linux.  In years of use I can't remember a single crash.ZFS does a lot for servers which you can't get on Linux.  I've heard of too many problems with btrfs, XFS lacks too many useful features (IMHO Red Hat's Stratis doesn't make it any better), and the promising bcachefs isn't ready yet.I haven't noticed any lack of support for server hardware but I've heard that can be a problem for desktop use.  I'm not one who likes problems so I use Linux on my desktops.I like the philosophy of OpenBSD but its lack of ZFS is a killer for me.  Dragonfly BSD seems like a perpetual experiment and for me NetBSD gives up too much for compatibility with  hardware I'll never use.So I'll say FreeBSD is great for servers but for other purposes your mileage may vary.  It's nice to have choices."

The system has exceptional reliability, and fault recovery, even when a show stopping programming error is made to low level routines.  Recovery from these errors is generally prompt and complete.  FreeBSD architecture has proven resistant to the steady stream of outside ""hacker attackers"" and had a very efficient move to IPv6 with few glitches.    It works on minimal hardware and scales up very well.  Device support is less than ideal, compared with Linux boxes, but we have been able to use embedded devices on raspberry Pi cards to interface well with FreeBSD.  On laptops, especially in early releases, there was some hocus pocus to keep the wifi working well, but as later versions were released, this stabilized.

Once I switched to it I never went back to UFS, although UFS is great as well.- Ports system- Sane kernel configuration file- rc.conf keeps it simple- I don't understand those who complain about hardware support, I mean you are using a network card which uses the ""em"" driver, right? If you choose to use inferior hardware that isn't meant for a server (such as Realtek) that is on you.- ifconfig is ridiculously easier to use than Linux distributions' ip command- Set up your host, set up your jails, check sockstat to make sure your bindings are correct, then just relax.- Separate base system from 3rd party software- Low abstraction compared to Linux distros.

Using the rc1 and Gnome, everything works out of the box which is awesome looking forward to the final release. A few annoyhing things I needed to tweak, but the problems were really with the applications themselves and not Mageia. Really like the fact that it has urpmi and dnf and they work both very well together along side the Mageia Control Center, which gives something a bit unique compared to most of the other rpm based distros. This could be my favourite distro of all, PCLinuxOS used to be one (it's been years since I've used linux on any computer/laptop). Installed on a new 2023 16"" Asus Vivobook (Alder lake) laptop."

In my opinion it offers a better experience on this laptop than Linux Mint, which I love and use a lot, being simultaneously leaner/faster and better on fitting the hardware.All in all, this beta is more stable and usable than a Fedora release and I use it in my day to day work (non technical)."

I have used every version of the Mandrake systems from free to paid editions and the one thing they all have in common is that they never break.Mageia 9 is no exception. The team have done incredible work with this latest release and everything feels as snappy and well put together as any previous versions. The KDE desktop is truly perfect although I've themed mine to my liking but thats down to individual tastes etc.Latest Kernel is pushed with this so all your hardware should work out of the box. Firefox web browser is the default but for me I went with Microsoft Edge Browser and Google Chrome Browser due to the fact I like using the Google set of tools and Microsofts Office Online products.I'm a long time fan of systems that use dnf and for me I would hope the devs turn to a rolling release base like Open Mandriva have done. Mageia is my daily driver on my main laptop so I would suggest just giving it a try as you wont be disappointed.  "
1584,2023-05-02, Mageia, 9-beta1,10,220,"Very happy with this distribution. It pretty much just works out of the box without much effort, and is very stable and fast, even Cauldron branch is surprisingly stable for a rolling development branch. It feels similar to Fedora, but has a more customized and friendly experience, that helps you if you are less experienced but also does not hold you back if you are an advanced user. The default KDE Plasma desktop is very nicely integrated, and other desktops like Gnome, MATE, Cinnamon are also presented well. I also enjoy the more old-school approach, as they kept Mandriva's old tools like the very useful Control Center, though I understand it is not for everyone's taste. I like that it is community-based and not corporate-based, and that nonfree and tainted software (like audio and video codecs) are in first-party repos that you can optionally enable, which is a great solution, and does not result in issues like package conflicts or update delays like RPMFusion in Fedora or Packman in openSUSE.Only issues I have is that maybe the wifi networking section of the MCC can be a bit better, there is no way to remove/forget a previously connected network, and sometimes it chooses the wrong network if two previously connected ones are within range. But it is a relatively minor issue.Overall highly recommended if you want something a bit more unique and community-based."

XFCE is my favorite, and this one is the most polished I've used. Installation was a little confusing, but once  it was installed and updated, I was amazed that an alpha version could be so stable. It is so stable and snappy, I am sticking with the alpha version until the final release comes out. Mageia was one of my favorite XFCE distros, but if version 9 continues to be this stable, my distro hopping days will be over. Once the final version is released, it should rise to the top of the list quickly. Great job developers. Couldn't be happier with this one."

Il n'y a que fort peu d'incidents à l'installation d'une nouvelle version, sauf parfois la mise à niveau en ligne. Pour ma part je préfère partir d'une image iso, ce qui est fiable.Le système d'installation est très simple et le choix des bureaux est large, Après avoir travaillé avec KDE, je suis passé à Gnome à l'occasion de Gnome2, et rebuté par Gnome3, j'ai opté depuis pour Xfce qui est mature et stable, rapide, léger et doté de multiples possibilités de gestion de l'apparence.La gestion des logiciels par Mageia est performante et aisée grâce aux .rpm et un logiciel graphique pour gérer les installations et désinstallations. Le catalogue est très riche et il est rare qu'il n'y ait pas d'archive .rpm disponible même pour des programmes rares et confidentiels. Ce logiciel de gestion des programmes CCM commence cependant à devenir vieillot sans perdre de son efficacité, mais on peut aussi faire appel à Logiciel (je ne connais pas le nom anglais) qui installe des programme sans perturber Mageia.Bien sûr les acharnés de la ligne de commande peuvent s'y adonner comme sur n'importe quelle distribution, mais pour un utilisateur ordinaire, Mageia est très intuitif, et je n'ai jamais vu de personne désarçonnée en utilisant mon ordinateur, même celles qui n'avaient jamais utilisé Linux.La communauté francophone est active, et un conseil est facilement obtenu sur le forum dédié. Même si c'est sans rapport évident avec l'efficacité de la distribution, le fait qu'elle soit gérée par une association non commerciale est un plus intellectuellement satisfaisant pour un amateur de logiciels libres."
1592,2023-01-02, Mageia, 8,9,90,"I was very impressed with the competence and documentation of Mageia. This distro benefits greatly from its heritage of Mandrake / Mandriva. Mandrake was the first distro I managed to connect to the internet in the early 2000s. I first installed the live version to USB, and liked it well enough. A while later, I used the installation DVD to do a full install to USB, selecting Xfce, and was very impressed with automatic system upgrades. I allowed Mageia to do the partitioning, and never experienced a problem. During the full install I was given the option to not install the Office suite, which saved me the trouble of trimming the fat. Installing Tor required some investigation, as it is not in the rpmdrake repo. Instead a sandbox version of Tor is installed from flatpak repo. Install flatpak, then use flatpak to acquire Tor launcher. I had to reboot for the launcher to appear in Menu. I could probably make a favorable comparison of Mageia to Linux Mint.PRO- This distro inspires confidence. The docs were good enough that I didn't have to ask the forum for assistance.- Fast boot - Trouble-free persistence on USB install- Not based on DebianCON- systemd- two desktop taskbars, top and bottom, reducing viewable workspace, looking cluttered - Greek pronunciation of ""Mageia"""
1593,2022-12-25, Mageia, 8,9,80,"This is a short report, mainly with reference to the update procedure, moving from Mageia-7 to Mageia-8, as described in the (excellent!) documentation on their website, chapter ""Upgrading online, using DNF (CLI)"".I am aware this comes kind of late because version 7 is dead (no more updates) for quite a while already and so was the OS on it's dedicated partition on my AMD FX4300, 8 GB RAM desktop PC. I've always liked Mageia, but somehow did not find the time moving to version 8, with the intention of skipping it in favour of version 9. As the release of the latter keeps on being delayed and the holidays allowed for some spare time I went for the upgrade today.All went well till the step `dnf system-upgrade reboot`. Even though the documentation advised to get myself a drink and watch the event, this took unusually long. After the reboot it was hanging at some sort of systemd trigger for ""daily update mlocate db"". After two hours I almost gave up, because I was under the impression that the script would perform the `updatedb` once for every day since the release of Mageia 8. I must concede that Mageia is installed on an old-school-non-ssd HD, but still ... Because I had to leave home I luckily decided not to break the process and let it run until I come back five hours later: voila, all done.Rebooted into the ""new"" Mageia 8, my compter and I were more than happy.I let several recommended DNF and urpme -cleanup procedures run in the terminal, recovering disk space while enjoying an up-to-date Mageia again. Awkward however that the version upgrade dropped some 80 kernel packages, i.e. vmlinuz'es, on the machine. It looks like the script installs every single kernel package since the initial realease. There must be a better way, to be implemented when version 9 comes.After playing around for a few hours I can confirm the following pro's of Mageia 8:* stable* fast and below average resource usage* awesome implementation of KDE / plasmashell 5.20.4* no steep learning curve, especially if you've used Mageia before* amazingly solid documentation on the website* on the few occasions of asking for help on their forum in the past, I always got super quick, competent and friendly responses.Looking forward to Mageia 9 final, as I'm not so much of an alphaversion, latest greatest, sometimes buggy -type of user ...."

In all cases the install seems to be running normally until it stops with this message. ""dracut Warning: Can't mount root file system."" I am using Ventoy on a USB with eight different Linux distro ISOs on it. All of the others install without a hitch, MXLinux, FerenOS, Ultramarine, Garuda, and Zoring. I researched the problem for a couple hours in a browser (in KUBUNTU 22.04) and found that this problem has been around for more than 10 years and no one seems to have a solution. I was impressed with some video reviews online. But it look like it is uninstallable on my machine. I tried setting my Gigabyte Mobo to UEFI and BIOS. I triedGrub, Grub2. I tried IOMMU Enabled and Disabled. I double checked the checksums . I downloaded the ISO file with Windows 10 and withKkUBUNTU 22.04. Secure boot is not an option on my Mobo.  From what I've learned the live installer installs a virtual file system into memory to get it started. The failure occurs when the installer tries to launch the OS. At that point it can't find its own virtual file system that it was supposed to install. This is a fatal bug. I mean fatal in the sense that Mageia 8 cannot distribute an installable OS for some computers. There is no reason that it shouldn't install on mine. So from my point of view Mageia doesn't exist."

I strongly recommend it installed this one on a lark the other day after watching a review on YouTube, and I must say I am really impressed with the fit & finish of this distribution.

If for some reason Mageia ends up failing me, I will go back to Slack.Went through many rounds of testing the other major players: Fedora, openSUSE, Kubuntu, Mint, and MX. Fedora came the closest to satisfying my needs, but there are just too many updates and a few bugs to go along with that.Frustrated, I decided to try a round of the Mandriva-based distros, something I usually would not do: Mageia, OpenMandriva, ROSA, and PCLinuxOS. All were very nice, generally, although there were some language ""bugs"" with ROSA, being primarily a Russian distro.To my surprise, Mageia won the day, doing everything I needed it to do, and doing it with speed and stability. I was also pleasantly surprised to find that it preserved all of my settings from the live version to the installation, something I have seen only one other distribution able to do (MX Linux).In this day and age, it seems that distros like Mageia have taken a back seat to the onslaught of the many Debian, Ubuntu, and Arch offshoots, with their ""hipster"" dark themes, short release cycles, questionable stability, etc. For myself, I am glad to have discovered Mageia and its somewhat old-school way of doing things.

1614,2022-02-04, Mageia, 8,8,10,"I've been running Mageia for a couple of weeks now.  It is very similar to my previous distro PCLinuxOS as they both have their foundations in Mandrake/Mandriva.Mageia feels a lot less polished than PCLOS.  A lot of programs I have come to depend upon are missing, or at least I cannot find them, from the repo.  I had to sideload Palemoon to get a half-way decent browser,  Why?  One of the things that I like about the Mandrake derived distros is their use of the *drake tools.  Diskdrake is surely the easiest of the partitioning utilities and I still don't know why more distros don't use it.  It's the same with most of the other tools in the suite.  Maybe it's because I am used to them but having looked at alternatives they just seem easier to use.Mageia scores well on this but there are a few things that take the shine off.  RPM.  Yes I know that Mandrake used RPM but PCLOS moved over to apt and synaptic, and that was a smart move.  I find it simpler to find the programs I want and struggling with RPMDrake was a step backwards.  The layout is not clear and as I said trying to find a particular program can be a challenge.Some of the other jobs that need doing after a fresh install are harder in Mageia.  I don't like the switch between having to double click in some part of the desktop and single click in others.  It took me a couple of days to track down where to find the toggle to turn off double clicking,  In PCLOS you are given the choice in the control centre.One last thing that irritates me is the menu.  In PCLOS it's clear, grouped in a logical fashion and is also easy to edit.  In Mageia the reverse is true.  Quite frankly the menu as presented is a mess and so far I have been unable to edit it other than move the entries up and down.I'll stick with Mageia for now as I was having severe problems with PCLOS but I will keep an eye on PCLOS and if I can get it to work better for me I'll go back in a flash.

1620,2021-11-14, Mageia, 8,3,0,"I don’t understand how Mageia is so popular when half the system applications crash. The OS only seems to look nice and more versions keep coming with not too many fixes. All the work can’t go into the GUI because everything else suffers and with the developers of Mageia, I don’t see they understand that. I’ve had problems and errors trying to update packages and the system itself and it became too much.I tried out another Mandriva based distro I recommend, Rosa, it has the tried and true Mandriva tools in it. I’d also recommend Alt, it’s like Puppy Linux with a lot of different edition type distros based on the OS and I like that."

1622,2021-10-31, Mageia, 8,10,50,I absolutely adore this distribution !  It strikes just the right note on every issue for me.  Thank you Mageia.
1623,2021-10-17, Mageia, 8,6,0,"In principle it is a good distro. Mageia runs well as long as you use the GUI tools. But in my experience it can break fast if you try to change configurations with the command line or if you remove the wrong package (I think because some packages have needless hard dependencies). Other major distros like fedora, debian oder openSUSE are more robust in this sense.Because I rarely use distros out of the box but want to tune my distro, I personally can't use mageia. But nevertheless I'm glad that Mageia exists."

On some pages there was a button marked ""expert"" - when I clicked to see it, I noticed that many additional customization options were available.Although Mageia also provides the Gnome DE that I used to use in ubuntu environment, I decided to use Kde Plasma in Mageia 8.Since then, I use Mageia every day and feel very comfortable. Everything I need to use is available.I also installed several additional packages, out of curiosity and for fun and leisure - the amount of software available is very large, which made me very impressed.So far, Mageia is pretty solid, without any crashes and receiving constant security updates.Good job, I congratulate you Mageia guys!

This is very nice MakuluLinux OS that i like it very much to switch between desktop theme style like kde Plasma, Lindoz, etc but i find it very puzzling for one thing is it took up a whole 1TB space and leaving just 50.3GB space which i just installed new OS and not much i installed.  I'm disappointed that it took up a whole 1TB space even it format correctly with 1TB and smaller swap space.  So Something add up on home system files taking up space like that is not normal as I cannot install any more apps on it that tell me you have low space."
1631,2022-06-11, MakuluLinux, 2021-12-17,1,0,"Makulu has been an interesting distro in the past.  Past Xfce and Cinnamon versions were pretty steady and solid.  I had grown to really like this distribution, but now Xfce and Cinnamon have been dropped in favor of Gnome across the board.  Gnome is a resource hog.  The website tries to acknowledge this while trying to make the case that the use of the Gnome framework and not the front end means it will not hog resources, but the proof is in the installation.  It fails.  It fails pretty spectacularly, in fact.  I have an older system (quad core processor) that runs like a champ if I am running Xfce, Cinnamon, IceWM, JWM, TDE, Budgie, Enlightenment or most anything that is not requiring massive memory (8 GB RAM on this old desktop).  KDE and Gnome simply will not run.  It appears that all the tweaking done by the Makulu team could not make this run on that older machine.  I tried it on my newer laptop (16GB RAM and a five year old processor).  It chokes on KDE and Gnome too.  Makulu was not the exception.  It ran, but not well.  One of the philosophical tenets of Linux has long been the ability to use Linux on machines that Windows has left behind.  Makulu's switch to Gnome has rendered it completely useless for all but the most modern machines (a disturbing Windows performance trend that has been taken up by the KDE and Gnome systems over the years).  I am sad to have to leave Makulu behind, but if it won't work, you have to move on."

Cons, I haven't found one yet, but will review when I do, however some will hate the fact that it comes with Chrome installed.I've been this using for a few weeks now and I actually think I'm done distro hopping now, I hope the developer can continue to maintain this project! "

I last used this back in 2016, but now (2022) when I go to the download page, it just gives an endless sequence of ""click here to prove you're not a robot"" with advertisements about pornography, prostitutes, and ""investment"" opportunities that are banned in most Western countries.  Six years ago, back when it could be downloaded, Wifislax had certain wifi-oriented tools that were lacking in similar collections suck as Kali Linux.  For example, it would work fine with cheap hardware such as Realtek, which (at the time) was not universally supported. But it also had nice tool such as AirSSL to demonstrate the evil twin wifi hotspot attack, and conversely it had EvilAPDefender which could warn you when it looked like someone else was running an evil twin wifi hotspot. As the name suggests, it was a collection of security tools with a focus on wifi, so if that's the particular aspect of security that you are interested in, this was the go-to collection of tools.  Other collections such as Kali LInux will have a wide assortment of tools for wifi security, but being a more generalist collection, they will also have lots of other tools which might not be of interest to you, if it's just the wifi security that you're interested in.  The flip side is that while Wifislax might have more tools about wifi security, Kali Linux will curate only the best few tools, so the extra tools that Wifislax includes might be more like diamonds-in-the-rough rather than the cream of the crop.  But at least they were extra tools, so you could try them out, and pick and choose what works for you. It's a shame that it doesn't appear to be possible download it any more. "

And by installing EPMAnother option for installing programs is the epm package manager - Ettersoft package manager, you can update the system, programs from repositories, programs from epm, flatpak programs, update kernels, remove old kernels with one command:sudo epm full-upgrade. After that everything works great. The only exception was that I had to grant ""sudo"" rights myself, because for some reason it was impossible to install or update anything in the console, but I hope that this will be fixed soon.

By comparison MX used 600 MB (Antix - under 200 MB).        Software installation seems easy with Synaptic.Negative (for me):        The Stick version is not Persistent as some suggest. 'Session Support' refers rather to saving some settings than to full persistence MX/Antix style.        I did not see an internal tool for a snapshot or a recreation of the  image on eternal media (for installed system).

TVHeadend is the complicated bit and is probably not for everyone.The issues encountered in this review don't surprise me. Streaming is mess with a great many people trying to both defend and violate copyright. Judging LibreElec on this is a bit like judging a vehicle based on how its driven. Many extensions are simply nothing to do with LibreElec or Kodi.I have used Windows Media Center, Mythbuntu, Kodi on Ubuntu and a couple of others (WMC for years). For a PVR I don't believe there's anything better than the combination of LibreElec & TVHeadend. It's rock solid stability and the complete absence of that old problem ""oh, you want to record something now, hang on I just have some updates to do"" means it mostly just works. The only issue I've had is sometimes getting unwanted later versions of recordings with a foregrounded person doing sign language.

Ubuntu Unity 22.04.1 LTS (Which does not appear as a reviewable option).So glad to see the Unity shell back again, apparently with Canonical/Ubuntu official recognition.Having used Ubuntu since 2007, occasionally LinuxMint, I switched to CrunchBang#!; but when Ubuntu with Unity was launched, I adopted it immediately. It was much easier to use that OpenBox, like having a cellphone interface on a laptop/desktop (I think that was the idea, because Ubuntu had the long since abandoned idea of an Ubuntu smartphone, although UBPorts are still working on it).When Canonical/Ubuntu abandoned Unity, I went back to CrunchBang#!, until Corenominal Phil decided to abandon that project. So I adopted wattOS, until that project was put on hold, and distrohopped Debian LXDE (good if you know how to use OpenBox and write keyboard shortcuts in XML), to Mabox (even better), then BunsenLabs, which I found to get slower and had terrible menus, then SparkyLinux Minimal GUI, which while very good, nearly messed up my printer, and has a very inconsistent repository (there are a lot of 'ghost programmes' in there that do not have an 'installation candidate' (no disrespect to Pavroo: they work hard, maybe too hard, and deserve more support)).So welcome home new-old friend, on my main machine again.The sidebar Launcher is so convenient and easy to configure.The (Super Key) Launcher, HUD (Head Up Display), and Menu Bar do actually 'just work'. Maybe I'm getting lazy, but they're a lot more convenient that having to go into OpenBox .config and manually edit XML files, much as I enjoy doing that.(The problem with OpenBox is its lack of consistency. Every OpenBox-fronted distro has a different menu. wattOS, Mabox and SparkyLinux's menus are all pretty clean. BunsenLabs' is almost unnavigable, a 'horse created by a committee'. OpenBox needs some kind of consensus to be viable. Obmenu-Generator is apparently 'abandonware'. Why? It worked!)IMHO, Unity keeps out of the way, and makes operation almost mouseless. Most operations can be performed via the keyboard.The fact that the person who 'relaunched' Unity 'DE' was probably conceived around the same time as Unity makes it especially poignant.Unity was a futuristic project, and now it is once again a present project for the future.Please don't give up on this, unless you can make something even better.Thank you to the Ubuntu Unity developers.And thank you to DistroWatch."
1670,2023-05-05, Ubuntu Unity, ,9,100,"Reviewing 22.04 LTS.So good, it got me using Ubuntu again, and I am generally a Debian purist. I could install it on Debian, but I would make it look like how it comes by default, so there's really no need. It's quite rare for me to like how a GNU/Linux distro looks out of the box without it impeding actual usability, so that's a definite plus from me. Aside from that, it's Unity. If you liked it then you'll love this, and if you hated it you'll hate this distro. I tend to have my own preferred programs, so I like that Unity is just a shell, and doesn't come with its own suite of programs. Still, Unity shines on smaller screens like laptops. I haven't tried it on a full monitor. The search is still good. Resource usage is comparable to modern GNOME with slightly better battery life.Ubuntu itself is fine, it's easy enough to get rid of the things people dislike about it, people complain about snaps so much but getting rid of snaps takes literally 5 minutes. LTS releases of Ubuntu are just Debian that is easier to install proprietary software on after getting rid of snaps anyway. Ubuntu Pro is slightly off-putting but for your average desktop user it's free and changes very little.Most of all, I am very excited for the future. Rudra Saraswat is extremely talented and I am looking forward to see where he takes Unity X once it's ready."

I will say that this version looks quite nice, and I wasn't as put off as I thought I would be. That being said, it didn't win me back to Unity. If you were not a fan of Unity back then, I don't think this will convince you otherwise. Other than that, this is a good, solid distro I would not hesitate to use as a daily driver...  The first thing I'd do after installing this is put a different desktop in it - which rather defeats the purpose.. "

Hit META, switch to the Document tab and the most recent documents are listed with legible thumbnails showing their covers. (Very often ""file history"" has tiny and/or generic icons or is a muddle, as in Office 365).This excellent handling of files is enough, here, for Unity to remain. Not that there is much wrong with it anyway, as everything in my first review holds. I have found a few more minor issues:- Whenever a snapped application updates, its icon in the Dock vanishes and has to be put back by hand. (An improvement would be to allow pinning of applications from the Dash without opening them, rather than having to open the application then pin from the Dock).- Application icon sizes in the Dash vary; for example, Firefox is larger than others.- The HUD isn't universal although, from reading up about it, it would require application changes to support it (unlikely given that Unity is an unusual desktop environment now, alas).- Screen scaling very occasionally reverts to 1 for no obvious reason; fortunately, moving it back to 2 sticks until the next, rare, reversion.- The bug with the launcher turning black (second reviewer) is confirmed here.- There is an option to show the user name at the top right, which doesn't do anything. In fact, it never worked and there were complaints about it not working when Canonical managed Unity. The option should probably be removed.But these are minor. Ubuntu Unity is a great distribution and has slipped seamlessly into Canonical's infrastructure so there is a steady stream of updates."

It works great, is stable, and easy to use. I have a HP Pavilion with an AMD graphics card and I had no issues installing the distro and it is smooth, fast, and responsive. I had no problem adapting to the flow of Unity after never having used it before. I imagine Unity would be a great desktop for a touchscreen device to. It comes with the Synaptic package manager GUI but I just use the terminal so I don't really care about that. In its default configuration, it still looks great but I really appreciate that they kept that Ambiance and Radiance themes around and you can easily customize it using the built in tweak tool. As someone who dislikes GNOME very much, I'm glad we have Unity back.Only notable issues I've encountered: Can't manually change accent colorTelegram notifications don't show correctlyThe global menu is a nice touch but doesn't integrate with all apps correctlyComes with snap"

Now I can use the desktop for the important things like work or development projects. Synaptic seems to be the only GUI for installing software so I simply installed Gnome Software to give me the same as I would have in main Ubuntu and it works fine. The more I use it the more I love it.

1678,2022-10-12, Ubuntu Unity, 22.10-beta,9,5,"Versions:20.0422.04I installed 20.04 only Core2Quad Xeon class computer and 22.04 on a Thinkpad X220.Both installs went relatively smoothly and stability and performance were on par with the best distro's I've ever used.  I've since updated the 20.04 on the Xeon-based rig and it was a smooth transition.Full disclosure... I was one of the Ubuntu users that disliked Unity initially.  I was used to Gnome 2 and wasn't happy Canonical ""moved my cheese"".  Eventually I came to really appreciate what Unity brought to the table and as it became more stable and useful it became my DE of choice.Once again I was miffed when Ubuntu pivoted again and replaced Unity with Gnome.  Try as I might, I can't bring myself to like Gnome 3.  I can't think of a single thing it does better than Unity; despite Canonical's attempts to make it behave similarly.  So I was pleasantly surprised when Ubuntu Unity came along.It's quite impressive for a first attempt at a distro, and especially considering the small size of the development team.  The style choices are a nice touch.  It's customizable if you prefer the previous look of Unity.I don't think Unity needs to go chasing new features (which seems to be what DEs are obsessed with these days), I would like it if they focus on stability and making the Unity features that we're used to work across the board.  For instance, the global menu doesn't work for all apps (i.e. Firefox).  Not the fault of the Ubuntu Unity team, but it would be nice if they could have the resources to offer an up-to-date version with a working global menu.All and all a decent distro.  If you miss the performance, efficiency and features of the Unity desktop, I'd urge you to give it a try.  I don't think you'll be disappointed."
1679,2022-10-08, Ubuntu Unity, 22.10-beta,10,1,"I'd be using right now if it wasn't for the usual and persistent grub issues I get if and when I boot another OS from an external drive.  Long as I keep using Unity, and don't boot anything else, it's fine, no issues.  I have Manjaro i3 on an external drive which is one of my backup systems in the event of you know, stuff going south because I can't resist playing.  After using Manjaro, it takes at least three hard stops to finally get the laptop to boot.  After that, no problems at all.  So, I'm speaking of a removable external drive, not a dual boot setup.Unity does have some quirks, which still aren't fixed from way back.If I select to base the launcher color based on MY choice, no big deal.  But, if I go back to and set it to be based on the current wallpaper, it turns black as charcoal, and stays that way even after reboot.  Compiz DNA I'd venture.I'm giving it a ten, because there was almost nothing to configure upon first boot.  Also, because I have a soft spot for Unity, and think it was a really bad choice on Canonical's part to go back to Gnome.  Nothing against Gnome, understand.Hope development continues."
1680,2022-10-04, Ubuntu Unity, 22.10-beta,8,11,"Years ago, Unity was the default Ubuntu desktop and GNOME was a flavour. Now things have turned around completely, and show how unfortunate it was that Unity was dropped.The authors of Unity have done a great job picking it up from a moribund state and modernising it - but not too much - and producing a desktop which is, above all, fast. ""Not too much"" because Unity was so clearly ahead of its time. 4K support is perfect, and the HUD (in an application, hit ALT and start typing; menu items in that application will be matched) has never been beaten. The Dash or application/file find (hit META and start typing) has been copied over and over again but the integration with the window manager is unbeatable.Once I stopped clicking the Recycle Bin (which is where the application chooser is in GNOME) the sheer efficiency of Unity really comes across. It is a very rare user interface where the keyboard and mouse work together effectively.The supporting applications are a mix of those for MATE, Cinnamon and GNOME (e.g. atril/pluma, nemo and GNOME Terminal/System Monitor) but gel together harmoniously.The only doubtful default installation is stacer. It is a combination of various tweak and system information tools, but doesn't cope well with a 4K screen and has some options which are not relevant to Unity. It should really be removed particularly as unity-tweak-tool, which is a highly impressive Unity customiser, is installed by default.There are a few rough edges which can be worked around:- No nightlight: install redshift and set it up as a startup item with command line parameters.- Desktop font doesn't match the rest of the user interface: install dconf-editor and change org.nemo.desktop.font.- PDFs and similar don't show previews on the Desktop; in nemo, set maximum file size for preview to a large value (say 1GB) rather than 1MB.The one which can't be worked around is that there is an option to set the accent colour, available from the system tray. Unfortunately this only changes some items, such as folders in nemo; others stubbornly remain ""Ubuntu orange"".These rough edges will be eventually be worked out and are not showstoppers. All in all, Ubuntu Unity is highly impressive.

1681,2023-04-17, HamoniKR, 5.0,10,1,"
Hamonikr 6.0 TaebaekBeen using it for about 3 weeks. This is like Linux Mint on steroids, with better theming and more applications pre-installed and more offered in the Welcome app. Hancom Office is one of such apps, and although it's Beta, I've not run into any issues so far. It has MS-Office style of layout like OnlyOffice, but I enjoyed it more than OnlyOffice, as it has all the essential features (some of which I felt are lacking in OnlyOffice). However, it's completely optional, and you have LibreOffice pre-installed, which is still my preferred office suite.The default browser it comes with is Naver Whale. This is a browser I tried out a couple of years ago and thought it was probably the best Chromium-based browser out there. Personally, I prefer Waterfox and Firefox, but if you're into Chromium, Naver Whale is definitely a better and more feature-rich browser than Chrome or many others. However, Firefox was also pre-installed IIRC. At any rate, it's always easy to install Firefox. Whereas with obscure browsers like Naver Whale, I think it is a good thing that a distro decided to come with it as a default, as this helps to introduce this software to more people.The Cinnamon desktop that the distro comes with is still my favorite, despite having a few rough edges. KDE is more feature-rich and prettier, but every time I use it, sooner or later I run into some critical issues. Whereas Cinnamon is stable and offers just enough customizability, while also retaining great performance and ease of use. This distro comes with an older version of Cinnamon than Linux Mint, but that's good with me, as I've not had the best experience with Cinnamon on the latest Linux Mint (21.1). Perhaps they need another year or so to flesh it out after some radical changes there recently to Mutter and the removal of the Metacity element.As it's based on Linux Mint 20.3, its Ubuntu base is also older than in the latest Linux Mint release, being 20.04 instead of 22.04, but personally this does not bother me at all. If this does bother you, however, you can always manually upgrade, there are plenty of guides online. What's more important to me is that everything just works. So far I've run into zero issues.One thing I love about this distro in comparison to Linux Mint is that it has Nimf pre-installed, which makes a configuration for unorthodox writing systems a breeze. For anyone learning Korean, Chinese or Japanese, this is a very good option to have out of the box, instead of having to go through a less user-friendly IBus or Fcitx configuration.I won't say much more about this distro because for the most part it feels like Linux Mint. And Linux Mint is one of the best distros out there. You can think of this as Mint+, a variation or a special edition of Mint. Some people will undoubtedly find HamoniKR bloated, but I always welcome more pre-installed software, especially when it's good software, which is the case here. While I could deduct points for a lack of originality, the fact of the matter is this distro provides a polished, user-friendly and efficient experience, and is great for work, gaming or casual web-browsing. And is, in my opinion, a better option for the learners of East Asian languages than Linux Mint is."
1682,2023-03-02, HamoniKR, 5.0,10,4,"Update - After 3 solid months of using HamoniKR 6.0 Taebeak on both HP Pavilion and Dell Latitude units I report that it's still a very solid OS.  Distro-hopping days are over.  Everything just works!!  The developers have nailed it and I'm rating this OS a 10.Installation: 10 - Standard Linux Mint-ish installation base, refined with smooth installation and good flavoring by the HamoniKR developers.Desktop Environment: 10 - Cinnamon desktop environment (DE) is the base.  It's configured and works beautifully.  Comes with Classical and Gnome 2-type layouts along with connection to a database of various Cinnamon themes to choose from.  The themes download and change without glitches or breaks to the Cinnamon desktop.  I absolutely LOVE the Cinnamon Desktop on this OS.Current Cinnamon Version: 5.2.7 as of this review.Wallpapers: 10 - You get a beautiful selection of wallpapers to choose from and if you're using multiple monitors then the wallpapers will populate all monitors smoothly.  No issues.System Updates: 10 - were smooth, no issues and I like the CLI interface detail outputs. The develops configured the CLI to highlight pertinent information in relation to the app installs, changes, updates, etc.Application performance: 10 - I tried and worked with all the major applications that came under the hood with this OS and all work well. All applications that I installed manually - no issues.Productivity: 10 - Priceless on this OS.  Priceless!!  Studying/research while listening to music and going back and forth between browsing, MS OneNote, making spreadsheets with Excel or Libreoffice applications, taking notes, making mind/concept maps, audio recordings, etc etc ..... all seamless.OS performance: 10 - Although this OS I must say does justice when it comes to stability but even on idle RAM utilization is kinda high hovering over a 1gb - 2gb RAM. You need minimum quad-core processing, 6GB RAM and an SSD is ideal.  HamoniKR does have a Taebaek Lite version.Hardware detection: 10 - Detected printer with no issues. After running sudo apt-get install dkms && sudo ./displaylink-driver-.run followed by sudo reboot the OS detected my dell docking station and all 3 monitors flawlessly. Quick, fast, no issues. No issues with audio, internal or external webcams. No issues with wireless or bluetooth. All works well with no issues.Side note: CrossOver Linux works flawlessly in this OS. My Microsoft Office 2010 installation works better on on this OS than on both Windows 10 and Windows 11 easily. That's sad being that it's Microsoft's product. This installation is also comes with the Microsoft Office app for the online apps as well.I strongly recommend using HamoniKR OS as a daily driver with no hesitation. Great for surfing, solid for production, and solid functionality all round. The OS needs more attention for sure. I've been a Linux user for almost 15 years and I must say I'm very impressed.  You cannot lose with this OS and it needs to be in the top 10 of Distrowatch.Well done HamoniKR Team."

This is normal, simply because people are not the same. I gave a rating of 9 because on installation I asked for automatic login, but on launch it asks me for a password.

Another invaluable advantage is the many highly polished kernels - with various CPU schedulers such as pds, bmq, tt and bore (in addition to the standard cfs). The only drawback I could complain about is the somewhat unreadable theme on the startup, but the theme can be changed very easily so I don't consider this a critical flaw.

It may be a bit too techy for some beginners, and there are numerous and constant updates once you get get started, but after being set up properly Xero seems to be a solid workhorse.

The cpu/memory usage is good and the whole system is stable and responsive. Yay works as intended. Konsole layout is nice. File is functional and designed for workload. Menus on top and bottom are meaningful and hide when a window is maximised. Window headers and min/max/close icons are nice, too. All in all, the best KDE I have ever experienced, hands down. Great job Xero team.

Install is also super fast now with the built in scripts. Pacman, AUR are also amazing. The rolling release on arch is very fast and very good, even better than opensuse tumbleweed in general, no need to worry about anything breaking at all. Arch linux along with the Sway tiling window manager is the unbeatable setup in 2023! The Arch Wiki is so good that you can find anything on it and its super clear."
1727,2023-05-03, Arch Linux, current,9,5,"Reviewer:Experienced user, Linux, BSD, MAC, Windows, DOS, CPM, etc2nd review (follow-up), on Arch, first review was favorable on an initial user's experience, now a couple years later, still impressed using the system.In general, the installation is poor for beginner, satisfactory for experienced, the operating system is good overall. Using Mate desktop (gnome2 fan)Pros:Very good, stable operating system, installed on 10+ systems. Hardware ranging from over 10 years old to modern.Even with the constant updates available, have not experienced any issues overall. The ability to acquire advanced features of software, I opted transitioning from Debian due to issues with repositories after systems ran for years. Debian upgrades did not always go smoothly, starting over was time consuming and disruptive. I don't recall experiencing a failed system update (rolling system updates), rarely reboot, with systems running months or more.In my experience, a headless Arch server has only been restarted in once in 2 years due to a 3 day power outage.Backups, cloning, and replicating is where the Arch systems really shine, transitions from one drive to another, one system to another are smooth. I can clone a clean system, or a fully configured system in minutes (via rsync).  This is my primary reason using Arch, maintaining the spouse's computer became trivial.Aside upgrading, cloning, and backups, Arch is comparable to running Debian or similar. Arch is best suited to someone experienced in Linux, for installation, once administered, anyone can use it. It is very trim & lite when first installed.Latest system install from scratch, System 76 Pangolin 12 (just release at time of review), installation was a little rough due to operator being rusty, once installed experienced crashes and lockups for the first few days, but has been running stable for a few days now after various firmware and driver updates.Boot time is 2 to 5 seconds on a fast SSD drive, operating system running well with heavy loads, several virtual machines, many browser tabs, etc.(Drivers and firmware was not an Arch issue)Cons:Installation was a bear (first time), learning curve steep, too many choices for a beginner, I recommend Debian for a beginner, far easier. I had just recently installed on a new laptop (for fun), and still was tripped up on the many steps to know, requiring a second system to look up information. On a positive note, I know there is work going on for helpful scripting to ease the pain.Forums - Before I used Arch, I found a wealth of general Linux help on the Arch forums and users were helpful. This is what actually encouraged me to try Arch.  Lately I see forum members scolding beginners referring to ""Reading the manual"", ""Not going to help"" in response to help requests.  I fail to understand why someone would bother to deter another user, rather than help, I find this behavior should be discouraged by admins and moderators.Updates become frustrating at times, some systems are updated less frequently (don't fix whats not broken), only to find everything is out of sync. Not a show stopper, but frustrating when trying to install a minor app or tool, only to have to update the system.  Admittedly, I know this is the philosophy, and it doesn't take that long to update. Fortunately, the repositories are usually in very good shape, and fixes are fast."
1728,2023-04-29, Arch Linux, current,10,2,"This is the best linux distribution available for linux power users. I have been on it since 2011 and absolutely love the speed, power, simplicity and customizability it provides. ArchWiki and the arch forums are a goldmine of information. Right from installation from scratch to solving any driver compatibility issues, search for it and you will either find a page on the wiki or a thread in the forum, given the large community of linux power users using Arch. It boots fast, installs packages really fast and keeps itself and all the applications always updated, so you don't have to worry about being on old versions of popular applications.AUR is beyond compare with most probably the largest repository of software available for linux. Any program not vetted and put in main channels can be found there and be easily installed with a helper or by hand using makepkg and pacman -U. This is a gift to humanity."
1729,2023-04-27, Arch Linux, current,10,3,"Arch Linux is a very fast booting and performing distro and has a boot time of around 15 seconds on a normal HDD. The installation process might be a bit hard for newbies but after one or two tries you get used to it.The pacman package manager is fast and provides all the info someone might need. But installing something from the AUR is painful if you don't have a AUR helper like yay or paru, and I think that functionality should be included in pacman just like paru does it. And the AUR has another problem: Some packages only have source releases, and no binary ones. Fortunately most packages either have them or you can just use the Chaotic AUR for that.And the last thing I want to mention is that if you have a problem that you most likely get a result either from the Arch Wiki or the Arch Forum. So even if you have a extremely rare problem, there probably already exists a solution in the Arch Forum or Wiki. Atleast that's my experience."

And the feeling of starting from nothing and putting it together yourself is gratifying.It's kinda like the software equivalent of building your own PC by buying the parts.I'm a relatively new user & haven't experience any instability issues yet.Although I am always prepared for it.Having to manually install & update using AUR for some packages doesn't feel all that nice.Seems like it takes a lot of effort to get something included in the official or community repos.Still, all-in-all. It's makes your system feel unique and your own.It's been my favorite distro thus far despite the extra bit of manual maintenance."
1731,2023-04-06, Arch Linux, current,6,2,"When I was using Arch, I did enjoy it. The simplistic nature of the packages with little to no dependencies is nice. No dependency hell. The community run project with no cooperate backing to force a direction can be a benefit for many. You choose what you want to install. But there are downsides. The AUR while nice, is just a big git repo where you have to compile. Half of the stuff won't build and it can lead to packages break. Also, printer drivers from brother don't support Arch Linux and when you can't find it from the AUR, you're expected to build it yourself. The community is just ugh. "
1732,2023-03-28, Arch Linux, current,9,0,"Arch Linux is the fourth distro I have used and the second that I have used for more than 15 minutes(I have been using it for about 4 months). Manjaro was the first I used for an extended period(about 3 months before I switched to Arch). Arch Linux is there for people who enjoy trying new software and don't mind having to do some work on the system now and then.Software is plentiful in Arch repositories. If a package is not in the repositories it is usually in the AUR. If it is not in either of those you probably do not need it. The official repositories include several browsers, Steam, most of the major DEs and WMs, 4 Linux kernels, and much more. Mojang provides an official AUR package for the Minecraft launcher. The PKGBUILDS provided by each AUR package should be read before building or installation.The documentation is very good with the wiki being considered one of the best. There is a wiki page for almost anything you could ever want to do on your system. Installation is not as hard as it seems but it is quite easy to mess up. However, your trusty archiso can allow chrooting into your broken system to fix it.While updates occasionally break the system, the Arch team usually posts notices to the archlinux.org homepage of these breaking updates as well as steps to fix the problem."

1734,2023-03-02, Arch Linux, current,10,1,"Installation can be a bit difficult (specially for newbie), but once you undestood how install it's always the same procedure, so you can setup an Arch system from USB to DE in about 15/20 minutes. There's also archinstall, which semplifies the installation process by guiding it.I always install Arch on my pcs because it's leaving me the freedom of doing what I want with my system, without installing apps that I don't need, pushing packaging systems that I don't want or deciding if i need codec or drivers or not.Not talking about AUR, in which you can find everything that can comes to your mind. If something it's not in the AUR, you can both create your own AUR package, helping who, like you, needs this particulary package, or compile it directly from the source (like every distro).On old or slow computer I feel almost obbligated in installing Arch: even with KDE or GNOME, the most heaviest DEs, it runs smoothly even if the pc has 4gb of ram and HDD. Setting zram up is really easy if you need it, and if you use archinstall, this will be done automatically if you setting it in the installer.Some years ago, Arch could be considered as an ""elite"" distro. But today I think it's ready to be mainstream. Yeah, even with archinstall it's not simple as Ubuntu or Fedora or other mainstream distro, but it's a good alternative for who want to learn something while configuring what the system needs"

I decided to try Arch again and it's been great. You just need to be mindful of what you install on the system and to double check when you do an upgrade for any known issues. So far so good and I hope to be able to stay with it for a long while. I am on a all MAD system for my main computer so I can't talk about how well the NVIDIA drivers are managed.

In only very rare cases something has to be changed manually, and the Arch homepage provides exemplary information about any necessary interventions. I appreciate the always up to date software, which comes quickly into the pact sources after it has passed the test phase. So you are always up to date and do not have to wait until a new release comes out. In addition to the official sources, you can also find many other programs via AUR that you may need in addition. Again, I have never had a problem with a package. The system can be installed individually and runs very fast. I can therefore recommend Arch without reservation. "

There is no such thing like a perfect distro for me, but there are less trouble distros and Arch one of them. For example if you forgot to install net-tools or network manager you could boot from arch iso, mount rootfs to /mnt and pacstrap required packages. There is another way, you may play with chroot and console's package manager but this requres a little bit more actions (yah, this works for any Linux). It's rolling and even if it formally may be an equivalent to unstable for LTS like manner, frankly it is more stable than a lot of LTS type distros (Ubuntu, Mx so on). My previous Arch installation was about 7 years ago. It still works until now but I decided to reinstall it.The cause is old configs for some packages that may be less actual after a thousands updates and may lead to performance impact.

Whatever I had to learn about Arch, be it the installation process or be it how to maintain it: It was a one time investment and I never regretted it. Coming from Windows (since Version 2) and many other Linux distros (my first one was a SUSE Linux 4.2) I was looking for a distro that suited my needs. Minimal, fast, KISS, easy to maintain (without the need to care repeatedly about broken dependencies), with good and extensive documentation, with a large and helpful community and finally bleeding edge. Arch brought everything to the table and so I still stick with it.If you are a somewhat experienced Linux user who prefers to spend his/her time using the machine rather than maintaining it (or fixing broken dependencies), then you are in good hands with Arch Linux.Pros:+ fast+ stable+ easy to maintain+ KISS principle (Keep it simple, stupid!)+ powerful package manager (pacman)+ extensive software repository+ very good documentation (english wiki)+ large and helpful community+ Linux self education (RTFM, Learning by mistakes -LBM-, Learning by doing -LBD-)+ bleeding edgeCons:- not for beginners or unexperienced Linux users (especially GUI-fanatics)- non-standard AUR (Arch User Repository) packages can be a pitfall.

I've had hardly any issues and certainly none of consequence with Arch. Being able to use the AUR without holding my breath, for fear something will break, has been great.Arch is quick, easy to use and solid. Those claiming its an enthusiast's distro might want to look at how far Arch has come.

Arch Linux allows for a high degree of customization out of the gate, while pacman (+AUR) provides automatic dependency resolution and support for the unfortunate proprietary blobs and software that (for now) some of us must still use. From the moment you boot into the installer, you are forced to make deliberate choices for your system. The reward for your labour is becoming a more adept Linux user, with a customized system. I use GNU/Linux because when I otherwise use proprietary software, within seconds I become enraged by these non-free systems with deliberately programmed barriers to functionality and customization. Arch takes the logic of GNU/Linux and carries it to a golden mean between extreme customization and easy maintenance."

I had to manuallyintervene only 3 times in 17 years!Living with a bleeding edge rolling release distribution such as Arch is a way to go for me!I would rate it 11 but : a) DW don't permit it and b) ... well I miss sysvinit.Keep up the great job and long life to Arch!

Their approach to proprietary firmware is quite reasonable.Package groups and metapackages like gnome, base-devel, texlive-most (i.e., packages supposed to be shipped together) simplify things. Their package policy (e.g., all of OpenSSL in a package named openssl, instead of client, server, etc. in separate ones) makes sense.Also, daemons aren't enable by default on systemd (which can be changed to runit, sysvinit, etc.).

It was the only distro which did all the things I wanted in a fuss-free way.Like many readers I have evaluated a large number of distros and tried Arch some years ago.For several releases of Arch I used the Anarchy installer and at times the Archfi installer script.Since the installer was packaged with Arch it has been much smoother and quicker.Arch is very fast. It boots quickly and shuts down quickly. Many distros shut down quickly now, usually within 2 seconds and Arch is among the crowd.It would be nice to have a GUI package manager installed by default but I installed yay and octopi without much ado.Once I got the hang of installing programs from the command line it was straighforward, eg:sudo pacman -S sanesudo pacman -S simple-scansudo pacman -S harunaArch pips Debian by having the most up-to-date kernel with 5.19.6-arch1-1 at the time of writing.Having the ability to run commands in Arch as root or as a user instead of the dreadful sudo is a plus point on my checklist.The vast repository of available packages has not disappointed."

1763,2022-09-02, Arch Linux, current,10,0,"I own many computers, all running different distros, and have used linux for a total of 5 years. I loved trying out hundreds of distros, from niche to popular ones. I have come to conclude that this is forever going to remain the distro for my main PC that I use for gaming. Love arch for desktop PCs, hate it on laptops. I used to install kubuntu for friends looking to slowly leave windows, but ubuntus tend to give me a headache doing IT support for, so now I simply force all my friends to get arch day 1 and it really is not nearly as hard as the internet claims for newbies to learn. With that in mind, I would not suggest arch if you are learning it all alone. The reason I and my many friends learn to adapt to it so fast is because I am the wife of a massive arch fanatic, have a few irl friends who used arch for a decade, and I enjoy helping others learn how to use it post installation. It is also the easiest thing for me to tech support. I am very paranoid and a bit lazy so I tend to tell everyone who is a beginner to never install anything from AUR unless it is some game emulator, bashtop, some well known other software like balena etcher, etc. I would suggest carefully think and research before you install a specific AUR package, because blindly getting tons of niche AUR software is the reason my arch used to constantly break. Nvidia gpus also used to mess up my arch, so I have since moved onto AMD with 0 problems since I switched. If you plan to use this for music production, except to get Renoise, otherwise you can try fruity loops but it might be tiring to get to work. Beginners can also consider trying out Garuda, something I left due to it one day getting an update that broke all my games, or Endeavor, both of which are arch based. Use GUI arch installer if you want regular arch itself. My favorite feature is using yay via terminal to install literally any program I might ever need. It is much easier than any debian or ubuntu based distro I used in the past. And of course, this is the number one distro for gaming. Every single out of my 500 steam games run perfectly except for games that come with EAC. Remember to use arch wiki, think before you install things, watch YT videos about arch, and you should learn it fast. Arch really is not as hard as it seems so long as you do not enter random obscure commands into your terminal. This is the only distro I will be giving a 10 out of 10 rating on here.Main cons>if you are learning alone, be ready to binge a lot of videos or read the wiki, but if you will only use arch with steam, telegram, krita, some emulators, this will not be an issue you should worry about.>if you need a lot of niche software from AUR, be ready to risk breaking your systemMains pros>so much easier to install popular software>flexible>comfortable>always modern, up to date>little to not bloat>amazing choice for gaming"
1764,2022-08-29, Arch Linux, current,10,8,"Arch Linux is great, custombizable, and lightweight(if you setting them) OS.It was thanks to him that I learned how to create and work with disk partitions, studied in depth what Linux actually consists of and how everything works inside. Also, thanks to arch wiki.Customization here is a strong advantage. I am not dependent on any programs that are pre-installed in my distribution, and I can do almost anything as I want.But, it's not for everyone. Complex installation, the need to understand what you are doing, as well as the possibility of errors due to the fact that you did something wrong. Errors happen mostly only due to the fault of the user (I have never had cases when something broke because of Arch). And this is good. And, I noticed that most of the problems - are solved quite easily, and there was no such thing as ""you are trying to solve the problem that you saw in the logs, but the error is located in a completely different place.""I also used Manjaro, and I had just a lot of problems. I couldn't install my software because there was some problem with the ""libc"" libraries, drivers, and other system stuff, and any googling about it was pointless. Simply because the errors were elsewhere, and were unknown.Arch is a flexible system. But it will only be good if you have the skills. If you are a beginner, it is better to install ""Linux Mint"", or another ubuntu-like system."

In my opinion it is as close to ""user-friendly"" as a Linux Distro can be. Some colleagues here blame it to be not ""idiot-proof"" - is that possible at all? And do we want that? A bit of Linux/Unix knowledge is required, when you want to tailor it to specific needs. If not, you will be happy with that, what runs right out of the box. I hope that this distro will live long and enable me to use tools as kdenlive for many years. Big THX to Texstar."

It is a general computing distro performing very well with Audio / Video and Graphics Studio software but also with some Linux friendly Game Engines for game developing general developing... except for Microsoft's C Sharp that is almost mission impossible to make it run, leaving some game engines that use that scripting language out of PCLOS world for beginners who start to learn it. Other than that, HW is recognized well and run without issues, but some proprietary network cards may become blacklisted after the first update, but there's no place for panic and all is needed is placing a "" # "" at network card name on the blacklist and it won't disable anymore. LibreOffice is installed by a custom script rather than straight from Synaptic Package Manager or via ""apt-get install"" on terminal and yet that script is wonderful on LibreOffice update process or in case a complete remove is required, but LibreOffice can also be installed manually or run by AppImage in the same ways every other distro does."

For those who like the old xp or vista you get that kind of feel to it. There's an option to change the kde menu to something that looks similar to Windows 10 if that's your fancy.Next is the Apt package management and the use of rpm's. Huge tick from me on that.The bundled in software is everything you need and the only thing I have added is the Google Chrome browser to which you shall find within the synaptic package manager. That's the other good thing, synaptic package manager is your only gui tool for installing your software and this I really really like as there's know beating round the Bush with when you need to find some software or package.You get all the usual Kde goodies and standard settings manager.So I like so far but now the parts that could be improved, firstly the wallpaper packs need to be greatly expanded from the 2 that come pre installed. Secondly the login manager is gdm but I would much prefer sddm as standard here so I wish they would change that or at very least give an option during the setup process.So a well deserved 9 but that's on a fresh install. I have fixed these things myself so I give my own system a 10.Pclinuxos really is and always will be that dark horse that will always surprise you. Solid, reliable and just a rock of a distro. "

After the change to an AMD-based machine, it finally start up and let me see how imperfect it is...To be honest, I always found stupid issues in just about every Linux/BSD distro under the Sun, but PCLinuxOS Xfce edition (the one I chose to test) certainly doesn't deserve to be called “the distrohopper stopper”. In reality, their developers did a lot of bad decisions. Among them, we must include the fact that the Xfce edition is configured to automatically mount NTFS partitions.

It amazed me to have an apt-get/Synaptic packaging tool in a RPM package distro. Also, the fact that it is a rolling release distro but absolutely stable and reliable. It is also light on the RAM and CPU and fast. Undoubtedly a great distro to use in day by day home office or even at work (I have installed it in more than a dozen machines at the university and worked fine).

I see a lot of Arch in PClinuxOS these days verses Debian, but that's just me. Before Arch users start flaming me, I said much like, certainly PClinuxOS is kind of it's own thing.  I can recommend."

I have it as the only operating system installed.The software collection in its repository is quite low when comparing with other major distributions, but it contains everything needed for an everyday Joe to run a PC like a desktop or a laptop.Few observations about this distro:1. The installation is very quick2. It is very light despite its 64 bit only architecture3. Has a classic desktop feel4. Functionality is complete with prominent applications like synaptic, control centre etcPCLinuxOS does not lean on to any particular philosophy, but just gives what is needed from a computer. It is entirely user run through community channel not backed by any company.An excellent linux distribution if you are willing to setup on your own system by learning."

1800,2022-02-08, PCLinuxOS, 2022.01,10,28,"After having been wandering through a dozen Linux distros from all major ""families"" (Debian, Slackware, Arch), I stumbled upon PCLinuxOS with the XFCE Desktop, one of the oldest (started in 2003!) and stablest Linux distros. What a breeze! It gathers the best of two worlds: easy of use and hackability.Pros:+ easy to use as Ubuntu, but faster and lighter, with its ""Control Center"", where you can hack most configurations of your PC without having to go to the command line;+ you can change and remove practically everything you want (including PulseAudio) through the command line; in other distros, PulseAudio and KDE telemetry are almost impossible to get rid of;+ no telemetry and no systemd;+ huuuuge variety of packages to install through Synaptic;+ it's a rolling distro: so, packages are constantly updated;+ their help forum is better (and faster) than most paid customer support services - and is free;+ fantastic community: people really spend the time to teach you the basics, and are super patient with newbies;+ super stable, packages are well built, with dependencies always met.Cons:- if there's one, it's an issue which most distros suffer with up-to-date software: you'll need a computer with a minimum 2 GB of RAM to run it fairly (internet but not with 20 tabs open, watching 720p videos, office, graphics editing), and 4GB to get it working really well, with HD, editing videos and the like.So, if it's so good, why is PCLinuxOS still unknown to many users? I guess it's because it has no big corpos like Google, Canonical or IBM behind it. It's fully funded by users, there are no ""top-tier donors"" telling what must be done."

The forum is the best I have ever belonged to, the members are friendly and very helpful. Even the developer, Texstar  with his many hours of hard work keeping PCLinuxOS up to date, adding packages and improving PCLinuxOS finds time to help members with any issues they may have.IMHO there isn’t a better Linux OS available for the every day user than PCLinuxOS!"

It finds my hardware with no problem.  Brother, Canon, and HP printers have all worked perfectly for printing. Scanning with a multi function can be sketchy but no worse than any other Linux distro I've tried.As a rolling release it stays up to date very well. The packagers are responsive if one of the more esoteric programs needs a newer version.  Newer does not always mean better so if there is a downside it's that a function that has worked well in the past may quit with an update.  PCLOS has a facility for making full remasters of the system as an .iso you can put on a bootable usb drive to go back to the working version. I do htis about once a month. There are other less cumbersome backup utilities like timeshift you can set up to take snapshots every hour and save for your preferred time from hours to years.Another big plus is the forum.  They tolerate fools the best of any distro I've tried.  The Big Boss Tex reads the forum posts and responds daily. Sometimes you may not like the response but it's always accurate and better than wondering if anybody cares. "

Stable is the name of the game with PCLinuxOS. With PCLinuxOS, everything just works, and works well.The main DE is KDE and Gnome, with community versions of Xfce, Enlightenment, LXQt, Openbox, and Trinity desktops. I'm an Xfce fan, so that's the version that I prefer to use.PCLinuxOS is a great choice for new and experienced Linux users alike. The user forum is extremely friendly and helpful.

To my mind they are the best available and diskdrake knocks all the others into a cocked hat for ease of use.  Everything was fine until the 2021 version came out and things started going wrong.  I have had enormous problems getting the Nvidia card to work and actually had to revert from 5.14.16 to 5.10.91 to get away from the nouveau driver.  Having successfully got the video card installed and working I noticed other problems.  A game called Sunless Sea had previously worked flawlessly but with the new distro it failed and even the people at Failbetter Games were stumped as to what had gone wrong.After trying the new 2022.1 things got worse and on a reboot the network failed and I could not get it to work.I agree with the poster on 12/01/2022 PCLinuxOS was a great distro and the folks on the forum are helpful, friendly and long-suffering with all the difficulties I posed to them.

I'm not very happy about it as it uses systemd and sudo, things that rub me up the wrong way but these days my computers are tools and have ceased to be a hobby and I am tired of struggling with what PCLinuxOS has turned into.  Like the Curate's egg, it's bad but good in parts."

The level of polish and sophistication is not found elsewhere. I found it very easy to install and select a role. After poking about a bit I started to wish they would make a daily-driver edition. So many small details have just been taken care of - Athena is a well-finished piece of art. I am planning to pop this on my next piece of spare hardware and to delve further that the few days I had. A big positive that I quickly did find was actually having a starting point. Other pen-test infosec distros just go, ""here are the tools, good luck."", assuming one already knows everything."
1821,2023-06-06, Athena OS, 2023.06.01,1,0,"It's simply rubbish, full of bugs. I tried to install it to several different machines including also VirtualBox-machines, but it's not only very slow due to massive downloads (although the ISO-image is around 2.5 GB!), but installation with Calamares always ended up with an error message concerning the packet manager. Partitioning is also an issue. You have to use GParted, because otherwise Calamares won't be able to create a usable partition table. It's a nice distro for people who have too much time and who don't know how to use their time. But for those who don't want to play games like bug-hunting, it's a waste of time. Avoid!"
1822,2023-03-30, Athena OS, 2023.02.20,10,0,"Have tried several different security focused distros, and I'm still in the learning phase. The amount of resources available to those learning with Athena OS is awesome, love the integrations they've included with the OS, and the custom theming is nice too. I really enjoy the roles functionality they've included as well. Installing the apps/packages that are needed for a specific role automatically is such a helpful feature. The team I've interacted with on Discord is nothing short of extremely friendly, and more than happy and willing to help resolve any issues someone might run into!"
1823,2023-02-18, Athena OS, 2023.01.23,9,3,"This is awesome! great UI, awesome integration with HTB among others. Very customized down to popup notification for new CVE.It's a little bloated, but you obv shouldn't try and run it on an old macbook. Only downside is no live usb version yet.Is based on arch , so bleeding edge everything, including blackarch repos built in. custom themes, great for beginners and I think some vets will like too!Seems like the right tool for a bare metal pentesting distro, hopefully will get a little more hardened with timeI hope this project sticks around!"
1824,2023-02-04, Athena OS, 2023.01.23,9,1,"At the start I was very scipic regarding Arch distro's. I am inside a community where they really recommend using Athena OS. At the start I had to get used to basic functionalities like installing packages, etc. But honestly this is one of the most fastest and reliable OS there is on the market. I am never going to return to Ubuntu (Debian based). With Athena you have the ability to install a lot of packages which provides you with a lot of freedom on what you can perform on the OS.So if you think to use an (Black) Arch OS, I recommend Athena OS."
1825,2023-02-04, Athena OS, 2023.01.23,10,6,"A perfect distro for pentesting and who want to start doing cybersecurity. It's lightweight and the developer is very friendly. I m beginner in cybersecurity and it allows me to install the tools which I want and even i can install specific category of tools. Awesome OS.I can start machine from htb menu while is really cool and even i can submit flag. I really like this feature. It allows so many themes unlike other distro. I m really enjoying this distro and planning to install it on baremetal bcz it very stable.

It is one of the best Linux distros I have tried, its hardware recognition and driver compatibility is incredible, stable and efficient for the development of WEB applications, KDE customization does not ask any favors from other distros, I have been working for 5 years now with RebornOS and I can't say that I haven't had more than one problem, but I have managed to solve them, it's Linux, one has to be willing to not give up, and that makes it great, thanks RebornOS team for making one of the best distros I've used, I'll look for options, but just out of curiosity"
1827,2023-06-20, RebornOS, 2023.01.20,9,0,"I have 2 machines with Reborn OS on them.  One is a desktop older i3 HP computer and the other is on an external drive using a Dell i7 sff.  I had a harder time installing on the Dell i7 sff than the other but was finally able to accomplish the install using the offline install.  I like Reborn OS.  I am enjoying learning more about it.  I am 2 years into Linux, and have tried at least 20  different distros.  Arch is at the top of my list (Manjaro, Garuda, Endeavour, Reborn OS, Mabox with Bluestar being my least favorite of the bunch).  Reborn is easy to use & installing via sudo pacman -U was smooth.  Setting up was smooth.  I like it as much as Manjaro."
1828,2023-04-27, RebornOS, 2023.01.20,8,0,"Been running RebornOS in a VM in VirtualBox, and been mostly loving it. I specifically wanted an Arch based distro that allowed me to use LXQt off the bat. I had already tried Manjaro on another computer and I still enjoy Manjaro. I've been using *buntu since 2007.1. The Reborn OS installer is top notch. Full GUI, hand-pick the apps you want, along with the desktop environment. Couldn't be better2. While enabling Snap and Flatpak via CLI is easy enough, the default Pamac doesn't support them for GUI installations. I did manage to swap the Pamac app for another one (lolz the same one used in Manjaro), but obviously uninstalling Pamac within Pamac didn't work. Did get the help of the Reborn OS forums, and they've been great3. Looks like VirtualBox guest additions are in the AUR and was installed by default, which is really nice!4. On the flip side, enabling shared folders (VirtualBox feature) was harder in Reborn OS than in Debian based distros based on my experience. Once it's done, it's ""set and forget"", but still, seemed to be more challenging than necessary (can't blame Reborn for that, it seems to be the process for Arch distros as guest)I'll admit that LXQt is less user friendly than Gnome or KDE. I was looking for the sweet spot between light-weight for use in a VM yet still more feature-rich than a window manager like OpenBox. I typically use Qt apps more than Gtk apps, so LXQt was the obvious choice...and Manjaro doesn't seem to have an install disc that ships with LXQt."
1829,2023-03-17, RebornOS, 2023.01.20,9,11,First time trying this. Very pleasantly surprised. The installer works fine. Can choose desktop environment. Its preinstalled with Firefox and Pamac and other tools. Pros-easy install-install went smoothly-come nice clear selection menus during install to customize it-light OS-the RebornOS Fire app is great easy way to install apps via a simple GUIcons-I have to nitpick to find some cons..but here a few small ones-a bit spartan but this is not a major issue as you can customize it-the wallpapers as very basic-the environment is not as aesthetically beautiful as EndeavourOS but functionally Reborn great.overall a 9/10

I tried to install Manjaro with no joy, and several other distros.Reborn OS had no issue, and then I discovered the other utilities for optimization, the multiple gui's, etc. and I found the installation experience to be very pleasant and the interface very well done.I would highly recommend Reborn OS for those who are moving from ""arch like"" to arch...I would like to thank the team for their hard careful work.Cheers"

1833,2023-01-09, RebornOS, 2022.11.13,8,3,"Reborn is an ""install Arch in a friendly manner with as little change as possible"" distribution and, to that end, it does so with little fuss using Calamares. It has a huge choice of desktop environments including some unusual ones such as Cutefish and UKUI. I chose Budgie, as a Budgie admirer.The Calamares configuration is unusually powerful as everything available can be picked from, although there are defaults set for each desktop environment. You could mix in tools from another desktop environment if wanted, although that would be potentially risky.Reborn's striking difference from other Budgie-based distributions is that the supporting applications are GNOME, most notably Nautilus. There has been a recent tendency to substitute those with alternatives (e.g. Nemo) because a big issue with GNOME applications is that those based on gtk4 libraries - more and more as time passes - cannot take themes from Budgie. So, here, I have a Materia dark theme with Nautilus, Calculator etc. white. This is not Reborn's fault; it is an intrinsic feature/failure (take your pick) of gtk4. A few gtk4-based GNOME applications soften this, such as Text Editor which has a white/black switch.Budgie is standard, with the big weakness in that being the poor Desktop; you have to open two Nautilus windows to move a file to or from the Desktop! I hope the speedup in development caused by Budgie becoming a Fedora spin will improve that, as it is the one glaring weakness in an otherwise excellent desktop environment.Other than the use of GNOME applications Reborn is a pretty standard Arch distribution. Unlike EndeavourOS there is a graphical package manager (pamac) which shows that there is an extra repository, Reborn-OS, which offers a lot - themes aplenty, firmware blobs for what looks like every Broadcom chipset ever produced and even standard utilities at newer versions than in the Arch repositories or AUR, such as 7zip v21.Reborn adds two applications of its own; Welcome, an introductory popup window on boot (which can be turned off) and Fire, an extra control centre. It allows kernels to be switched between, display managers similarly, and secondary desktop environments to be installed (potentially dangerous - I wonder what a cross between GNOME and KDE would look like). It also allows a number of the ""big"" proprietary applications to be installed, such as Steam or Wine.Overall? Now my daily driver as it is pretty close to standard Arch and the theming and general configuration is good. I had to do very little to get a decent desktop appearance. We shall see how the use of GNOME applications stands up, given GNOME's determination to take a very particular view of how its applications interact with everyone else and its dislike of theming."

I had a matter with the pc and the avaliable iso was not working to me. I stayed lose on this time. But now ReborOs is back and I'm using again. It's a perfect arch, almost there is not additional packages what is wonderful. Kde, gnome, cinnamon, budgie, ukui, mate, lxqt, xfce, and anymore. The online install finishes about 12 or 15 minutes. I said 'wow' about this. How is possible? But it's true. I liked so much that I moved the operational system on my 3 pcs. And two of these were with windows and windows is working without no problem after ReborOs. I'm very happy and I desire a very long life to RebornOs project.

I installed KDE Plasma but right out of the box it didn't even have the system tray and task manager widgets in the bottom panel.3. Repos are also missing, it install flatpak directly although the installation showed it does have AUR support. Did not see any option to activate it, at least not from a GUI.4. It is very laggy (in the VM) not sure how performs on bare metal.It might be an option for some people, an okay choice if lacking any other option but even so, even for tinkerers, I don't see why would chose this over EndeavourOS or Arcolinux.It does have a nice installer and a big variety of DEs."
1837,2022-09-08, RebornOS, 2022.04.10,9,1,"I have had RebornOS running on my main production laptop for nearly 2 years now. This is one very under-rated distro! From the installer to heavy daily usage, this has become the benchmark for me to measure my other machines against. All the goodness of Arch, a wide choice of desktops (I chose Cinnamon), and all very customizable as one would expect.  Being Arch it is not quite for the new user or Windows refugee - a couple of years Linux experience is recommended before trying out Arch and this, RebornOS. I have had no problems, just a few minor glitches with dependencies and those came from stuff building out of the AUR. A great and solid distro which stays very, very updated. The updates can get annoying on some days, hence the 9 not a 10 rating."
1838,2022-07-06, RebornOS, 2022.04.10,10,2,"If command line and days of setting things up is not an option, Reborn is a breeze. I found the system installation super easy and fast. The distro set of packages is HUGE. In the end I had to download from browser just one(1) app, a microsoft one. This distro is fast. I felt XFCE desktop with ""plank"" as snappy as MacOSX on an M1 machine. I can't believe I run a clean Arch Linux with a pure GUI interface. Although at first I was worried about that ""rolling release"" thing, finally found it stable."
1839,2022-07-05, RebornOS, 2022.04.10,10,1,"It is one of the friendliest linux distributions I have ever used. The need to use the terminal/""command line"" is even less than a windows system. Easy and fast installation. Very easy to use graphical package/software manager. Really fast times on installations and updates. Fast boot and shutdown procedures. Handy welcome screen to help you setup everything in your environment. The big gun is the software repositories. I found everything in there. This saved me hours, even days of setting up my music production pc.The only negative is that you have to schedule frequent backups with timeshift because some installations can break the system. But with timeshift it's easy to get it back up and running. Of course, this does not only apply to rebornOS, but also to other linux distributions and windows systems.Thank you Reborn.Keep up the good work!"

Endeavour is more like Arch in the repository department, but RebornOS is more like Manjaro in having their own repository.  I was very much impressed by how much was installed without my intervention.  I found the installed packages were useful and for the most part:  up-to-date.  I chose KDE for the DE, so I could play around with customization and found it to be so close to EndeavourOS it was almost a deja vu system.  I wonder if the same team players put it together with the same ideology.  I haven't found any serious quirks with this distro.  You could say it's a good beginner Arch based system much like Manjaro.  Try it!  "

I was able to install to an SD card, including setting up an EFI partition, without touching my fixed disk - that can be hit and miss with some distributions.I'll test it in Virtual Box for a while before deciding whether it should replace Manjaro.

Coupled with a small SSD it remains usable for most lightweight distros. The install was interesting with the ability to choose or more importantly not to have certain types of software installed - something I'd like to see in all distros which keep trying to force Firefox on me and a number of 'must have' programs that I don't use/want.I picked games for some reason, and didn't check what games it was adding either. I assumed it would be the smaller ones, but it's actually most of the bigger ones and adds a significant amount to the downloads required. Something to avoid unless you're a keen gamer.I went for the LXQt desktop to give this old machine the best chance of running smoothly with only 4 GB RAM and an old laptop quad core CPU.Good news it's probably the fastest to login screen I've ever seen on that old Lenovo - by a significant amount at around 10 seconds. Obviously helped by the SSD, but I don't think it will be too painful on a mechanical drive either.I do a very basic acid test on all old machines to see if they're still viable and that is - can it run YouTube videos in full screen smoothly?  It passed that test with flying colours and seemed plenty fast enough for other programs too.For an old machine that couldn't possibly run Windows 10, or even 7 without a struggle, it's now a more than adequate general surfing machine."

It was a exemplary install this time, with a very helpfull Cnchi installer. The party trick for Reborn is the choice out of a myriad of desktops! The chief conclusion after install: everything worked just fine, from the network connection, to the different configurations, adding the sofware packages, Grub (and my triple boot install), even the wireless keyboard bindings and yes, even Netflix on Firefox 88.0! The system idles at around 496 mb ram on the desktop.+ positive: extensive choice of desktops, impressive pacman/pamac package management, highly configurable system- negative: issues with live cd, a certain lag in launching apps and a sometimes annoying shearing in the screen when browsingReborn is definately worth a try if you are curious about an Arch based distro without the steep learning curve that comes with vanilla Arch. Just avoid complicated desktops like i3, Openbox or other exotic ones.  Go for the popular KDE, Gnome or Cinnamon, that come very slick and polished. Is it a keeper, even a daily driver? Too soon to tell as there are still a lot of configs and functions to test. That is probably the difference with the likes of Mint, Ubuntu or Manjaro. Those feel much more like a 'ready to go' system. Reborn feel more like ""a project""."

I'm using KDE, but there is GNOME, Deepin, Budgie, Cinnamon, MATE, OpenBox, i3, Xfce, Enlightenment and LXQT. On the past I tested Cinnamon, mate and Openbox. For those who love the terminal, there is even the option of a Base install, allowing you to bypass the Desktop Environment entirely. RebornOS gets out of the way and lets you decide, not the other way around. Besides this, the ISO has over many optional features to choose from as LibreOffice, WPS Office, Steam, Wine, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Vivaldi, or Brave – it has it all. And all of this can be accompanied by a light, simple, easy to use system that comes with pamac enabled and the possibility to install packages in snap or flatpak without requiring the user to go through a high knowledge curve. It is really an Arch Linux ready and easy to use.

Pros - Easy to use once you understand which files to modify for Raspberry Pi usage this is simple. Does have the ability to install apps using dietpi-software which allows you to set up various things which may be useful.Cons - If you are not aware of how to use Linux or have not looked over the DietPi Docs this is tough to set up and use properly.Overall, if you READ the docs and understand how to cut the sd card and set up the wifi, the process becomes simpler.Been using this for years and it does the job!

Whatever they did to achieve this behavior, they now don't care to fix it (my bugreport not even being acknowledged, not even them saying that they don't support my older board anymore but listing it on their website).The head of the team has an alarmingly unprofessional way of praising their script collection as advanced in all regards.

I understand that some users (and reviewers) find it not immediately intuitive or easily helpful and so might be inclined to give it a lower rating. As a Unix user since the mid 1980's and Linux user since version 0.2.13 of SystemRescue back in May 2004, I know, through successively using multiple versions of SystemRescue since, that is a tool that is well worth having on hand, worth persisting with, aids in continuing to learn more and more about Linux/Unix and has the capabilities to allow an experienced user to solve difficult problems or perform complex tasks. For those who might read this and think, “well, that is OK, he obviously knows what he is doing or is some kind of expert”, I would like to say that I am still “learning” and enjoying the reliability of this distro. Yes I do use a Linux desktop distro [MX Linux] as my preferred “daily driver” but I also still am a Windows user as well, since MS-DOS days.

1874,2023-05-28, Ubuntu MATE, 23.04,9,7,"
I am a low-tech user who has used Ubuntu-Mate for several years. Being low-tech limits my Linux options. I selected the Mate version over Ubuntu because Ubuntu-Mate makes it easy for me to save icons on the desktop. I keep things like the updater there so I can do computer housekeeping with fewer keystrokes before I go online and open files. Just open the dropdown menu, find the software, right click and save to desktop. Ubuntu offers the Mate desktop, but I decided to run Mate through Ubuntu-Mate, thinking the Ubuntu-Mate staff may solve some bugs not addressed by Ubuntu if I just selected the Mate desktop. I know the Cinnamon desktop offers the same feature for Ubuntu now. Oh, since the download file was smaller on Ubuntu-Mate, I was thinking Ubuntu-Mate would run a little faster on my old computer than running Ubuntu with the Mate desktop. Remember, low-tech user here. That was my assumption, not a statement of fact.I have Mate loaded on two HP's that are about 7 and 9 years old. I use the 7 year old one to do things like banking and taxes where I want my information to be secure. I have updated from prior versions for a couple of years on that one. I play with 9 year old computer when I have time. I have a fresh install of 23.04 on that one.The 9 year old computer with the fresh install runs almost as fast as the 7 year old computer. The 9 year old HP used to be much slower, so Mate must be running faster now. Being a low tech user, I have no idea what has carried over from prior Mate versions that slows the 7 year old HP down. The main difference that I see is old theme that I think was called blue-submarine is not available in 23.04. The color/theme options are very limited with 23.04, but that may be a tradeoff for speed. I know more themes are available by download, but I am a low tech user who usually fails when I try to use the terminal. That will be something to play with on the older computer when I have time. I want to vote for a little more ""visual variation"", but with my Linux computers being 7 and 9 years old, the footprint and function may become more important to me soon.I used to play with other Linux versions in VirtualBox, but something happened a few years ago where I lost the ability to make it full screen. I know that is an issue with Ubuntu, but I used to find a way around it by clicking full screen as soon as I started the virtual system. I finally found some time with 23.04 to work through some other issues to get VirualBox working at about half screen. Now I can play with VirtualBox again if I can find some time.I don't use a printer at home or do online gaming or Bluetooth anything, so I can't give any advice on those issues. But if you want to resurrect an old computer that Windows refuses to run on or just want to get away from Windows, I highly recommend Ubuntu-Mate for the low-tech user.If you find a Linux home like I have and can afford it, try to make periodic financial contributions to keep them available: Ubuntu-Mate, Ubuntu, Libre Office, etc. I need to check when the last time was that I contributed. Thanks Ubuntu-Mate team."

Sometimes upgrading the kernel, the zfs-dkms doesn't automatically build or upgrade, requiring a maual upgrade of zfs-dkms.  In 20.04, I would use grub-customizer to then put the zfs root entries on top for booting directly into the new kernel.  I know 22.04 now has grub-customizer as a third party repo pkg now, still a hassle because you need to add-apt-repostitory2. Snap is a disaster.  Snapped up programs are slow, it is good for embedded ARM kiosks, oh well3.

My belief is that MATE more resource hungry than Xfce, but just barely more demanding.I was blown away in comparison to what I had used before. It's very stable and elegant while retaining the resemblance to Windows OS so you don't need to sacrifice your current familiarity with the desktop layout; its very beginner friendly. Its Software Boutique is a nice collection of software for everyone and it includes essential downloadable software and additional software for anyone (although for more software flexibility I would download GNOME Software or Appgrid, etc...)I've got Ubuntu MATE running on a small form factor PC with 8GB RAM, 500GB SATA SSD, and Intel J4125 @ 2-2.7GHZ, no fuss.It's got everything a Linux distribution needs: stability, elegance, support (quite a bit!), and fast performance. The future of this Linux distro seems bright to me!"

For my use case this is simply unacceptable and I had to find a work around on line. (purging the snap and connecting directly to the Mozilla ppa) I've been a very happy MATE user for years. The 20.04 version was truly excellent, but this latest upgrade has no benefit and a bunch of new annoying bugs. "

I also have no problem with Snaps - apart from Firefox I have another one on this laptop and they run fine and update in the background to save me worrying about that. I love that I can have a stable system in the background but also the latest software for other things I choose to install (and I find that Snaps run much better for me than Flatpaks or AppImages). I don't care about loading times because once they're up they're up, and if I close and re-open it's instant - anyway the Firefox snap loaded quicker than Brave installed from its repository, so make of that what you will.I get that geeks won't like any of the above (hey I don't even care about systemd or non-systemd, makes no difference to me), but I'm just a normal user who wants and needs something that works and doesn't give me a headache - I'm not interested in tinkering and if something goes wrong I can find a solution pretty quickly thanks to Ubuntu's popularity.For that, Ubuntu MATE is perfect. Thanks Martin, and all the others who make it that way."

A couple of things have always been consistent with it, firstly it would crash when l first attempted to use Tweak, and secondly it had Etcher in the Software Boutique which never downloaded, at least for me. l see that Etcher is still in Boutique, but at least it has a warning now that it is unsupported, to be fair the stock usb formatting and iso writing is perfectly acceptable unless you require persistence, which l don't normally.   The install went as normal, no issues, and surprise, Mate Tweak worked without crashing, set up my usual Pantheon desktop, l think l read somewhere that the team were aware of an issue and this version should fix it so kudos to them. l was interested to see that Firefox is now installed as a snap package, for some reason it took appreciably longer to load, but it did have a nice feature of putting Facebook in a container for privacy.   The one niggle for me in this version is something l have never come across before in any version of any distro l have tried, if l have two fingers on the touch pad of my laptop and have the cursor on the right side of a loaded page for scrolling up and down, the screen flashes erratically on and off until l move the cursor away from the edge, nothing in the touchpad and mouse settings helped so l used synaptic package manager to load a couple of alternative desktops to see if it was a bug with Mate or maybe an underlying conflict but had the same result, so l think l will do a fresh download and clean install., think l might give Elementary 7 a  spin when it drops as well.   "

Beautiful, fast and for now stable, I had only one problem in the customizations sw (Software Boutique) with the installation of Tor browser that once installed does not seem to work, but I think to solve it in the next days. Once copied the data also the customizations are fast for the clear organization of the menus. It's the first time I use Mate but I didn't think it was so responsive coming from Openbox and since I wanted to limit the manual customizations on the menus etc. I decided to switch to a distro on which I don't have to intervene at system level. The alternative for me was to switch to XFCE but I don't particularly like its look and feel so here I am in Mate and Ubuntu.  Also Caja File Manager I found very interesting, I did not know it usually using Thunar or lately PCManFM.Overall it seems to me a distro very accurate in the details and this is an indication of a support group of great quality which is important to have fewer problems as possible :-)Great distro! "

Installation was seamless dualboot with Windows. And on the other PC I upgraded over version 20.04. And everything went well, although the new version still needs some fixes.I just can't understand why Canonical and Mate are summarizing the colors of the themes, only white and dark mode. This is very bad for eyesight.

I do have to build the video-camera driver with Apple firmware, and I also build a TpLink wireless USB-3 dongle driver, since the Apple MBP Broadcom wifi is old, slow for X11 over SSH and not well-supported in general.   Annoying a bit, and I need to learn how to use DKMS, for auto-builds of these, on Ubuntu kernel updates.Ubuntu MATE for me, has been very stable, fast and very usable as a ""daily driver"" Ubuntu for a SW developer, with very acceptable ""desktop GUI overhead"".

My problems are that mate on here has been sluggish for a while and has some outstanding bugs that are yet to be fixed. With the distros *ubuntu, I mean like Kubuntu, Xubuntu, etc.- the Ubuntu family desktop alternatives, they do have the Ubuntu parent distro spyware built into it, they are pretty resource intensive and a bit sluggish- basically nothing has really changed here since the Ubuntu family desktop alternatives all adopted the spyware from Amazon into their distros without any care for the users, other Ubuntu derived distros have not adopted Ubuntu’s spyware. Overall, it is a sad state of affairs with the Ubuntu family desktop alternatives, but it’s good there are Ubuntu based distros out there that refuse to keep everything Ubuntu pushes with no reason for the users and which become increasingly more user-unfriendly and resource intensive.

After reading a bit about how the MATE desktop actually beat its competition with regards to power efficiency, I just had to give it a try... and it completely won me over! As of now, I'm convinced that the MATE desktop is the best desktop there is for Linux. It is the only one stable and fast enough to provide a pleasurable experience. And what's more, you don't have to install plugins in order to make it work like you expect a desktop to work! Simply excellent. At this moment, the latest Ubuntu LTS release has also reached a point of maturity, so it's perfectly usable without noticeable problems. I'm really wondering why Ubuntu doesn't have this as their default desktop. But at least Ubuntu MATE is a part of the official family or whatever. I'm just glad I can have a functional system even today, and I don't need to look back to how good things used be ten years ago. Amen. "

Ok TTY works, let's do initial update & upgrade and afterwards apt remove lightdm followed by autoremove and reinstall it. Well hold up, autoremove also removes nvidia drivers and their dependencies right away. Starting to think wtf, but ok let's boot now despite knowing we'll need to come to TTY again since we probably pulled in some new stuff with the upgrade.Boot back to TTY and install nvidia drivers. Reboot and everything works as I expected.Running out of characters but add on to this the fact pulseaudio crashes/has a problem upon most boots and the fact mate-netbook and/or mate-netbook common causes firefox to have double header bar and transparent ghost padding on tiled mode, I sadly cannot recommend this distro atm."

I personally use Fedora with GNOME 40 and prefer a more modern GNOME experience (GNOME 3.36+) however I tried Ubuntu MATE 21.10 and was astounded by the default configuration options. For a beginner there are a lot of options and the distro is easy enough to get a hang of. I would recommend this to beginners with the likes of Pop!_OS and Ubuntu.

There are 2 to 3 must-have applications for me that are not available through Ubuntu repositories, but are available as DEB packages. 21.10 MATE encountered errors while trying to install them - even after 3 or 4 tries and reboots.

I believe that's from Gnome 2 but i still find it way better than the settings menu in Gnome 3 (and 40 now). Not a unique feature of Ubuntu MATE (e.g. Yast in OpenSUSE) but it is very useful.- The Software Boutique, a nice starter for new and old users who want to find popular packages quickly. The app itself look nice and runs better than Gnome Software, but it's very limited in the selection to be used as the only package manager and it's also buggy. I hope they'll expand it in the future, turning into something like MX Package Installer or integrate it with Synaptic.The only negative for now is that it is buggier than i thought: window decorations not behaving correctly when tiling or resizing, few issues with selected apps, an error message keeps showing at every fresh boot, it complains about the ayatana printer indicator (despite my printer is working and i flagged the ""do not view this anymore"").To be fair the release has just come out and it's not a LTS version, but maybe because Ubuntu in general is among the most used Linux distros, or the fact that this is a 6 months release and not weekly, i was expecting a little bit more polish."

It follows the Puppy ideas of generally operating as root (except online where spot is used) and omits the source compiling features (but can be added) so you have applications like LibreOffice, VLC and GIMP in a tiny 515 GB iso. It is excellent as a Live USB stick using Rufus. The Puppy type Savefile collects all all your changes and settings without the performance loss of persistence On the next launch everything reappears as you left it. When your Savefile gets too full, just do a Remaster with all your changes incorporated in the new iso and add a new Savefile on exit. I've added applications including Firefox 108.0 to my current iso.There is a Fatdog topic on the Puppy forum where your questions are answered quickly and often by the developers."

However, that's only the first impression: There's plenty of ways to install software: Gslapt/repositories, SFS, pip install, compiling (works like a breeze).But I digress. I'm marveled of the way it's thought and made. It's ""natural"" for me how it is done. Puppy is pure genius, no doubt, but FDog64 is ""elegant"". Moreover, regarding Puppy, one eventually miss some more ""organized"" way to learn more about the system; that's where FDog64 outshines Puppy: its origin being intertwined with LFS (another marvel) is a ""plus"".I can't really be thankful enough for FDog64 not using pulseaudio or systemd BS (sorry Poettering's fanboys). I don't know how long will last this sound design decision, but in the meantime, I thank for it.Recently I've read an article (from 2017) in LinuxInsider regarding a prior version of FatDog. I can really say FDog64 has done a long way since then. Documentation and help is, again, amazing. Existence of man pages is a sublime decision (something I sorely missed in Puppy, despite the fact I could access a web version). They're SO useful to me!As a personal note, Openbox/Lxpanel is a winning tandem for me (I could never get used to jwm). So, I took my chances and compiled lxpanel 0.10.0 (with a minor tweak to be able to close apps, clicking over them in task list with mouse wheel).SUCCESS!And last but not least, I'm pretty excited by how easy is to create packages in FDog64! A MUST! Thank you for the help!Believe me when I say I could go on and on and on about the merits of this work. Thanks Team FatDog64!"

This distro needs work, pacman keys don't work. The install instructions don't work using the site docs.The distro sounds good from a security point of view but missing a setup/install program.A working windowing desktop VM would help to evaluate this distro. A windowed live iso would also be useful.This distro reminds me of the original slackware floppy based releases where you had to console install everything.What a waste of time, can't figure why this is rated 10 by so many.Why should the user be concerned with pacman keys, or the name of network devices, or setting up a network?No Cigar."

AlmaLinux OSVersion: 9.2Use: DesktopDesktop Environment: GnomeArchitecture: x86_64Hardware: HP Z230 workstation, 16GiB RAM and assorted SSDsI have been using AlmaLinux 9.2 as a desktop operating system for about a month.During this time it has impressed as a very stable operating system.Peformance is snappy and seems a little quicker with an ext4 root file system, rather than the default xfs.AlmaLinux 9.2 was installed without any issues using a boot iso and a network install. Note: AlmaLinux seems to have a similar issue to recent versions of Fedora, where the installation media won't boot in UEFI mode on some older motherboards.A good selection of desktop applications can be obtained from:* AlmaLinux repositories;* EPEL and RPMFusion third party repos; and* Flatpaks.As AlmaLinux is 1:1 binary compatible with RHEL, documentation is not an issue.The caliber of the companies backing Alma Linux is reassuring, as is CERN and Fermilab's choice of AlmaLinux as their standard linux distribution.I also like that AlmaLinux is community-driven and that the AlmaLinux OS Foundation is a non-profit organisation.AlmaLinux does everything I need a desktop operating system to do and does them well."
1935,2023-03-21, AlmaLinux OS, 9.1,9,1,"Very good distro, but I have found many issues in tradicional installation procedure, however using the live image it performed very well, recognizing my notebook hardware and installed without any error. I'm going to use for desktop not server, but I hope the lack of packages can be supplied by flatpak, snap, gnu guix, appimage and docker apps.I'm using Almalinux because I do not want to install and reinstall my linux every 2 or 3 years. Most distros haven`t a good end of life and Rolling Releases breaks to much. I have used CentOS8 for some months and it was amazing, management of system resources are expectacular, too much different from ubuntu that eats all of your resources."
1936,2023-03-07, AlmaLinux OS, 9.1,9,1,"Downloaded and installed both versions, KDE and Gnome.  Both without any issues whatsoever.  Even found how to add repositories on their Wiki page.  Solid, sturdy, and quite beautiful to boot.  Will use this for quite a while I think as it was solid.  Adding Flatpaks was easy, as was updating, and customizing.  I should say I am quite familiar with Red Hat and Fedora, so this was a no brainer for me.  So far so good on two machines, both DE.  I hope this project will be around quite a while.  I like Rocky Linux too, but not too keen on the name, i get why, but just rubs me wrong.  Alma (soul) makes sense.  Love it."
1937,2023-02-04, AlmaLinux OS, 9.1,5,0,"Overall I really like the 9.1 version, fast and responsive desktop! Well structured and easy to manage.

I don""t like the idea of portable apps.

The transfer tool does not work properly and has crashed my system to where I needed to repair my boot loader, I don’t know why it did that, but it feels like to me rushing out another version just to get a newer number or a point with a number is not good.

The server is hosting websites and Is running well. The server and desktop systems are stable, and I have no negative issues to report. The Community is active, and it is easy to get information when asking questions. It also runs great on the laptop and has no issues when installing or afterward."

Pinch to zoom works flawlessly not like Ubuntu 22.04, I have been a Ubuntu user since 5.04 but this has changed the game for me. I know its touted as a server distro but who says you cant use it as a desktop, hell its even built into the installer ""Workstation"".

1943,2022-10-29, AlmaLinux OS, 9.0,8,0,"I've waited to give Alma time to develop before installing but did so with 9.0 onto a problematic Compaq notebook with no problems at all. Some users without previous knowledge of CentOS might be frustrated with a few things such as how to get recognition for external drives but solutions for such issues are easily found and to be honest if they prove difficult to solve a Debian based specific desktop distro would be a better choice. Otherwise Alma is running fine on my hardware, is fast and stable. It certainly scores extra points for the live ISO options and it's the KDE version I ran and installed from. The installer is not difficult, try Arch or Void, but even these are easy enough second time around and not everything uses Calamares. I still fall short of recommending distros designed for server use as desktops, especially for home use, but Alma does fit the bill for a long term stable release that is unlikely to break with the next update."
1944,2022-09-30, AlmaLinux OS, 9.0,9,0,"So I installed Almalinux 9 some months ago. I needed a stable Linux version which can handle all my hardware components including my Supermicro motherboard with Xeon processor, and AMD video card. The most important was my Samsung SCX-4521F scanner-printer that somehow I could not install on any Debian based Linux distro fully. Either I was able to scan but I cannot print or reverse. But everything was OK on Manjaro, Fedora, Opensuse also. Why?So I began to use Almalinux 9 as a workstation, and until now it is perfect for me. A little bit faster than Opensuse, Manjaro was the fastest, but not the most secure and stable one.My choosen desktop is Gnome, but I would prefer Cinnamon.Unfortunately on Almalinux 9 there is no solution in the Almalinux forum, where another user also need it without answer. I think that a good Linux distro must be capable to handle the most all of popular desktop versions like Fedora do it for example.Note: On Cinnamon switching between tasks is easier with using only mouse than do it the same thing on Gnome.This is why my rating is only 9."

Is is very slow, not stable, the community is unhelpful and the devs are non-existent. Don’t expect patches, bug fixes and such to be done with this distro, it’s all a whole mess here. I am tempted to completely drop Red Hat/Red Hat based server distros and just go to Suse’s enterprise product. I would say this distro is even worse than CentOS became when they switched to being a beta testing distro not for the community anymore. Lots of bugs and crashes I’ve experienced too. Did something else better and don’t waste your time here, this is a migraine-inducer dealing with Alma."
1946,2022-09-12, AlmaLinux OS, 8.6,1,5,I have tested AlmaLinux twice in the past several months. Despite installing OK I found a huge deal breaker: it will not recognize a USB flash drive! I don't have time to scour the web and look up what to do to fix that problem which I have NEVER seen while testing dozens of different distros over the past 16 years. It also fails when trying to install and run packages using Flatpak. Rocky Linux installs and works fine with flash drives and Flatpak. With just those two things Rocky does rings around Alma! I simply gfind it impossible to use AlmaLinux at this time. Need I say more?  
1947,2022-06-27, AlmaLinux OS, 9.0,10,0,"I installed AlmaLinux 9 on a bunch of machines over this past weekend and it went great. My VM host boxes and storage are all update and working great. I can honestly say I am happy with this distribution. They release at great speed, which if you remember the LAAAAG for CentOS releases it used to drive everyone crazy. I found AlmaLinux a breeze to install and use.

Claims of Alma being ""slow"" or ""bloated"" are ridiculous, it's a RHEL 1:1 binary compatible  distribution as in it works exactly the same as RHEL, CentOS, Rocky etc. The clincher for me is that it was set up by the Cloudlinux team who have been working on RHEL clones for donkeys years.

Is it just me or was Hydrogen the best looking BunsenLabs release so far? Lithium I didn't really care for that green style, it was cool but not my style. As for Beryllium the dark theme is amazing and very polished, but it kind of ruins the fun when there's 7-8 other themes to choose from, which I also would consider bloat and just adds to the underperformance of the distro itself, also I don't seem to find a way to get rid of the themes that I don't need since I'm only using the dark theme, maybe you can.. maybe you can't.For every release since Hydrogen they've just added and added stuff for the sake of adding stuff. What happened to BL? It used to be really fast and snappy. I hope they surprise me with the next release, which would be ""Boron"". Another important fact for new users to keep in mind is that BL is always late with their new releases, which is the main reason why I'm using another Openbox distro which is similar to BL.Maybe most of this is nitpicking, but this is my honest opinion and a deal breaker for me, BL could and should be alot better, I mean their team is really good, but maybe the devs are busy with life in general, who knows really."
1985,2023-05-15, BunsenLabs Linux, beryllium-1,8,7," Very good when one comes to terms with it. As with directly Debian based distros, Ubuntu obviously excluded, the offer is overwhelming. But user interface isn't intuitive at all before one investigates the menus and finds out what is what and where is that. I might be too critical here, I am a hobbyist. I'd like to praise the looks of the distro though. And it is not sluggish, I've got it on old HP laptop from previous decade.  For someone working in IT this would make a good tool. If that someone knew the ways with (GNU/)Linux distributions. And if the employer would not buy a Mac... After all BunsenLabs Linux has all that one needs, if not already in place then easily accessed with apt. A freelancer would save a pretty penny. But of course time would have be invested if one's not familiar with these."
1986,2023-05-07, BunsenLabs Linux, beryllium-1,7,8,"Generally this is a good solid distro. I would wish that they had a centralized tool for configuring things. As a many years user of SuSE I was very spoiled by YAST, and now that YAST has been released under GPL, I think more distribution should simply start using YAST. Failing that, putting everything in one menu items would be a huge help, right now somethings are in the ""System"" menu item, but some things are not (e.g. network configuration) and some thing are in Preferences, e.g., Power Managment.Kudos to them for also including Blackbox window manager integration, and that is important to me, although getting all the black box tools up and running did take some time.It is fast and responsive in most apps, although the Firefox seems to lag quite noticeably.There forums though are not accepting my email address. It is a .duck.com email address--it shouldn't be that unusual, and so that is why I downgraded it."
1987,2023-05-05, BunsenLabs Linux, beryllium-1,5,23,"I prefer Crunchbangplusplus over BL, but BL would be my second choice out of all the other distros out there, but there's just too much going on with BL that is unnecessary, the Blob theme manager is buggish too, switched between two of the themes and some apps still had the color from the one I just switched from. No need for 10 themes, when you can ship a distro with only a light or a dark theme, the rest the users can figure out by themselves.  For me the true successor of CrunchBang is Crunchbangplusplus, not what BL has become, a true mad lab."
1988,2023-03-11, BunsenLabs Linux, beryllium-1,7,7,"This may sound harsh, but it's about time that BL got its act together & come up with a release that is worthy of being called a successor to CrunchBang#!, which was my preferred distro for years.On the surface, it is very good, with its auto-updating menu & general appearance; & the use of logical, sensible keyboard shortcuts that are a direct continuation of #!.There is also the very good post-install 'bl-welcome' script that launches on first boot.I made a fresh install on an old netbook that I use for data backup. 'bl-welcome' includes the option to install PAE support, which is great for old machines, & it is commendable to the Debian ecosphere that it continues to support what is still useable old hardware.But there are several failings, or at least, oversights, with 1/2 a point deducted for each one, (from 9/10, because there is not a single 10/10 distro).BL cannot be installed offline. There is no excuse for this. It is not a netinst distro.Synaptic package manager does not come with either apt-xapian-index or software-properties-gtk included, which make synaptic very clumsy to use. Fortunately, I know what to do to remedy this problem, by installing them. A newcomer would not.There is no firewall installed by default. UFW, which should be a standard, now has to be installed as an afterthought.But perhaps the worst thing is that it cannot mount LUKS encrypted external drives, because liblockdev-crypto2 is not installed by default. This was mentioned in the BL forums 3 years ago, yet still it is not included as standard. This is not only laziness on the part of the developers, it is heinous.So that's 2 whole negative points.Furthermore, the BL website claims that their repositories can be added to other Debian based installations. But they cannot, because there is no wget for the signing key. Following the instructions, an .asc file can be downloaded from github, but there is no apparent way of installing it. dpkg does not recognise it. The only way to access the BL repositories is to install BL to hard drive.By way of comparison, SparkyLinux repositories are easily added.So, for the sake of a few MiB, if that, BL is severely lacking.But at least it works, although I would not recommend it to newcomers to Linux.Wake up 'bazy lones'!"
1989,2023-01-06, BunsenLabs Linux, beryllium-1,3,2,"lithium-3 ran perfectly. The speed was the major aspect to why I have used Bunsenlabs all the way back.Crunchbang was wonderful, compact, fast, ran what you needed. Every version since has just bigger and slower.This had now peaked at beryllium-1. Just holding a window and dragging the file manager round the screen flickers at a slow frame rate. Playing a youtube video the frame rate is unwatchable.Something must be wrong that it can be that slow. Newer versions need to get faster again, otherwise it worth finding a smaller alternative."
1990,2022-12-30, BunsenLabs Linux, beryllium-1,10,0,"It is actually not a Linux but DE. Architecture independent sets of scripts, themes and icons that could be installed over any Debian based distro. Even a developer had suggest to install it in that way. So I play with it a liitle on my armv7 Chromedook with Devuan-ceres installed. I did add link of berylliumt repo to apt sources list then update and install bunsen-conky metapackage. And i got a Bunsenlabs linux on armv7.Pros: small ram footprint occupied by DE, easy customizable if you know bash..Cons: user should have some expirience on scrpting; stability depends on used base so if you installed it on Ubuntu or Kali then do not blame developers for bugs. Unfortinally the source is down week or so."
1991,2022-08-13, BunsenLabs Linux, lithium-3,9,9,"Love it. Fast, simple. The new lithium version I tried has the feature that I was missing before, hit super key and type the first few letters of the app I want and hit enter, it starts.  With this, I have a very very fast system.  I made a portable version by installing to an SATA so I could try it out on a few computers without the USB.  Dang fast.   The color scheme is great.  I like a nice flat desktop color that lets me see my windows, not a picture, it comes default that way.  This is a no nonsense, get things done and quick type of distro.There are features when you boot off the USB that will let it run in the RAM as a live mode.  I have not tried that but that has to be way faster than my SATA at mb per second.  My other favorites are MX for the tools and easy use, and I like Debian for stability and I still like Gnome, even though it is a hog.  If you like MX, and using terminal, keyboard, and want an uncluttered rocket fast system, portable or installed, give this Bunsenlabs a try.  I am glad I did and came back to try it again.  "
1992,2022-06-16, BunsenLabs Linux, lithium-3,1,0,"If only Bunsenlabs was as brilliant as some of the other reviewers claim.Firstly, it cannot be installed from running live.Secondly, it cannot be installed without it being connected to the internet, but it cannot be connected to the internet from the installer. The only way around this is to reboot while connected, and go for the install option at reboot.This all makes for an unsecured system that could be hacked by someone else on the same network while being installed. They could have all your login and password details, without you even knowing.Furthermore, there is not even a firewall installed by default.And then, there is the i386 version cannot be connected to the internet at all, other than wifi, and then cannot even be installed from live usb because it cannot find the cd-rom.None of these factors were a problem in CrunchBang#!So, with the exception to the general appearance of Bunsenlabs, there is no way that it can ever be claimed to be a continuation of CrunchBang#!"
1993,2022-05-23, BunsenLabs Linux, lithium-3,10,6,"If Debian made an Openbox version, then this should be it.Wait up, it is.Phil Newborugh started a riff with CrunchBang, & BunsenLabs turned it into a great composition.Everything works really well, and it is very well put together, with sensible keyboard shortcuts, which the BunsenLabs team have made even easier to edit.My only con is that there isn't a light/minimal 64bit version, that doesn't have an office suite by default.  I have to remove that after install, as well as other programmes. I would rather add components to a minimal system than remove excess.Also, 'Swap-off' would be a good install option, as swapspace is not really necessary any more on a modern system.Otherwise, BunsenLabs is the best Openbox fronted system available. All of the others are pastiches of CrunchBang.If BunsenLabs upgrades to Debian 11, then I have no doubt that it will be even better."

I hop that an in-place upgrade to Bunsen Berylium/ Debian 11 is easy and available in Q2-2022.  Good documentation and discoverability built into the menu.

1997,2021-12-26, BunsenLabs Linux, lithium-3,10,8,"BunsenLabs Linux Lithium-3 deserves an 11/10, for offering such an elegant solution.Having been getting tired of the slowness of other 'lightweight' distros, I tested several live distros, and BL won the contest.Pros:It's based on Debian Stable.It's a community project, rather than an ego-trip that may suddenly be abandoned.It's not a rushed out project: there has been no sudden upgrade to Debian 11. The BL developers would rather take time to ensure the stability of the final release, & it shows. Think about how long it took to reach the first release.The installation process is very easy, regardless of which approach is taken, from graphical to text to expert to automatic.The post-installation script makes things even easier.Configuration of everything is very easy. All the tools are there. If the menu seems cluttered, then edit it. Try that with an orthodox menu.There are no orthodox menus to get in the way. Speaking of which, there are direct menu links to a multitude of online resources, which is actually more useful than a limited number of site-specific-browsers. Think of the possibilities.Everything is made easier, by default, which not only makes it ideal for newcomers (who can learn a lot just by using BL), but also ideal for an advanced user who has greater priorities than endlessly tinkering with a system.Cons:There isn't a 'lite' version.It cannot be installed without an internet connection, otherwise installation fails at checking the repositories. Then again, many distros cannot be installed offline.There is not a rose-red theme.

Would love to find a browser that can load sites the way they're ""supposed to"" look, but it's a tough request of a 15-year-old computer.  I did snag LibreOffice and, thanks to this very lightweight distro, clicks and keystrokes work immediately, which is something that has not happened with ANY other lightweight distro I've tried.

But that's not the fault of the Gnoppix creators. The change to to light modus don't worked satisfying.I changed to german keyboard und connected the wlan. That's worked very fine.Then came the very big astonishment:There is the promise of ""Enhance your privacy"", but no preinstalled Tor Browser - why ????There were two installed Browsers - Firefox ESR ( that's OK ) but the secound was the Edge from the dark side of the IT World - what the hell ????This Gnoppix is faster and more fluid than Talis. I am not sure, if these two Thumb driven OS have the same goals and purposes.For me self Gnoppix would more interessting with preinstalled Tor Browser and without the Edge from the dark side of the compurtworld.In any case, this Linux distribution is so novel in its conception, and stands so uniquely in this forest of interchangeable arch and debian derivatives, that it deserves a review from Distrowatch as soon as possible.Three points off because of the Edge."

In my opinion, this is one of the best linux distributions for everyday use (internet, multimedia, etc.). My favorite graphical environment of this distro is XFCE. The system is stable and very fast. It is also very easy to configure. My wifi connection is stable, no so far i have problems with the sound or graphics. This system can work for me without any problems for 5 hours without a break and nothing breaks down. I personally recommend this system even to less advanced linux users.In my opinion, this is a distribution worthy of interest."

The only problem I have is intermittent sound via bluetooth when connecting a smartphone, but the rest works great. It is a Rolling Realase system, so once installed it updates without the need to reinstall when a new version of the system is released. The LXDE version of the system is very light, consumes little RAM and is very stable despite frequent updates. After a month of use I had no problem with it. Timeshift works in this system without any problems if it gets a full snapshot of the system. The system itself takes up very little disk space and I generally recommend it for the typical user be it Desktop or Laptop."
2013,2023-05-21, Archcraft, 2023.05.01,10,4,"	An outstanding Openbox experience.Archcraft really does many things right when we seek for a minimal but yet very visually and coherent polished experience.Switching skins on the fly in Openbox and you can see how the theming is handled in a superior way compared to KDE.The nuances of the theming shine and you have control over element like the shadows to make them more suddle.Some themes maximize a lot screen space availability with compact elements. Its appreciable for power users who bring many elements at once or work on small screens (retro screens, small laptop users can appreciate).Having little bloat installed out of the box offer an increased stability. (updates integrates smoothly and can be delayed further).The distro pushes you to get familiar with the usual terminal commands, once learned you enjoy the speed and enhanced control over your system. Then the provided other WM allow for a quick transition into a keyboard centric navigation workflow.This way of using the system doesn't fit very well my graphic designer use case but it teaches me what become more advantageous that way.Archcraft is used as a learning and transitioning OS for those curious to discover the beauty and responsiveness of fast WM.I installed it alongside xerolinux (KDE) and it made me want to learn arch more.

Not only is it fancy and pretty, it leaves you with grub fancy and pretty, and boots the operating system you chose last time. Those kinds of details make an operating system win points. It comes with yay pre-installed but no pamac or octopi: it doesn't matter, with yay -S pamac-aur installs in a minute. I have installed Archcraft Xfce and everything is going smoothly: for me it is one of the least bloated arch distros.Some complain that it has no support. It usually happens with one-person projects. But I think if you are a regular arch user you don't need any support, you already have the arch wiki.Great job!"
2015,2023-05-04, Archcraft, 2022.09.16,10,3,"An outstanding Openbox experience.Archcraft really does many things right when we seek for a minimal but yet very visually and coherent polished experience.Switching skins on the fly in Openbox and you can see how the theming is handled in a superior way compared to KDE.The nuances of the theming shine and you have control over element like the shadows to make them more suddle.Some themes maximize a lot screen space availability with compact elements. Its appreciable for power users who bring many elements at once or work on small screens (retro screens, small laptop users can appreciate).Having little bloat installed out of the box offer an increased stability. (updates integrates smoothly and can be delayed further).The distro pushes you to get familiar with the usual terminal commands, once learned you enjoy the speed and enhanced control over your system. Then the provided other WM allow for a quick transition into a keyboard centric navigation workflow.This way of using the system doesn't fit very well my graphic designer use case but it teaches me what become more advantageous that way.Archcraft is used as a learning and transitioning OS for those curious to discover the beauty and responsiveness of fast WM.I installed it alongside xerolinux (KDE) and it made me want to learn arch more. Power user who reinstall their Arch based distro periodically and want to be set quickly can love it."
2016,2023-03-17, Archcraft, 2023.01.20,10,1,"Greetings! For a long time I wanted to put myself one of the two systems, something from Linux for everyday tasks and experiments. After reviewing several distributions with different environments, I accidentally caught the eye of Archcraft.Of the environments, I liked Openbox, and in this distribution, it seems to be, by default, along with Bspwm. After installing and using it for a while, I realized that whoever made this distribution made it as if I were customizing the system for myself.And then I installed Hyprland and now it's my main working environment.From hardware, I have an Asus B-150M.2 motherboard, 8GB of memory, an Intel i5-7400 processor, built-in video. I use it at home as the main system for everyday tasks.From the pluses for me, I didn’t have to dig into the settings a lot, everything worked out, as they say, out of the box. Well, the cons are the little things that you should not pay attention to.Removed Firefox from applications, installed Yandex browser and qbittorrent.p.s. Neofetch says I have a Sway. Yes, and don't care. :)"

I don't know how to make beautiful UIs. I am just a guy doomed to use Spring Boot on my job. I just needed something functional and visually appealing. And that's when I found Archcraft. I am not gonna lie people, the dude behind this distro did and amazing job over the years. I am very much in love with his work. I am praying to my knees for this distro to keep getting updates for many many years. I know this distro have little rough edges but I sincerely think everything is gonna get better and smoother as the time passes by.If you are looking for something new, fresh and astonishing out of the box, I can't recommend Archcraft enough.  10/10"
2018,2022-12-03, Archcraft, 2022.09.16,10,2,"Since its release, out of curiosity I have tried it. I was struck by its versatility, lightness and stability, I continued to use it as my first operating system. Personally I installed the desktop mate only because I'm very familiar with this environment. Possibility of shaping it and adapting it to each one's use.The distribution is very light and the somewhat dated PCs come back to life. I have tried many many distros based on archlinux including arch itself, archcraft is my favorite distro and will continue to use it. An excellent job also from the point of view of graphics, pleasant without excesses, infinitely customizable. I have 3 PCs at home and on all 3 I use archcraft, my wife also now uses archcraft :-)Thanks Aditya for the wonderful work! We hope to release a customized version with desktop mate ;-) VOTE: 10"

First to do after installation is to update the system and then you can go on . With the pamac installer i set up the basic system in all way what i need , example : thunderbird, libreoffice , gimp and so on . Also flatpak and the setup in the pacman.conf is easy to go . The multilib repository was not activated , thats why iam wondering i had some errors in installing some packages ( wine 32 bit ) .Its fun to setup a system for daily use individual in all ways .I tried some other distros before but here i found a funny distro what i like very well .Learning by doing and its a good way for a beginner to see how a system and its components is working .Archcraft is running stabil and i had no errors so far after complete setup . I hope this distro moves up in the ranking. Would be pretty cool !"

2021,2022-10-29, Archcraft, 2022.09.16,1,5,"I recently installed the latest official release of Archcraft with XFCE in it. The installation went smoothly, without errors and/or without any surprises. This system is completely unprepared for use. A number of settings are not remembered and return to the default state. The system crashes every few minutes and it becomes impossible to work. According to the intention of the author of this system, this distribution was obviously supposed to combine convenience, versatility and ease of use. Unfortunately, all of these features have been implemented exactly the other way around. Such a crooked and inconvenient to use distribution I have not met yet!! (("
2022,2022-09-22, Archcraft, 2022.09.16,3,3,"I am writing about the Openbox version.The ready-made themes look great.Useful scripts for switching themes, menu settings, a lot of other cool scripts, e.g. for recording the desktop.It makes a great first impression.Unfortunately, this is where the advantages end ...After installation, it is unfortunately worse.For example, if you change the resolution with the XFCE utility ... after rebooting, you can see tiled wallpaper and polybar in the center of the screen. There are many shortcomings of this type.The number of problems suggests that the authors do not use it on a daily basis.From me 3/10, I cannot recommend this distro to anyone at this stage.But it's worth downloading and at least having fun with the themes in the live session."
2023,2022-09-17, Archcraft, 2022.07.18,10,9,"Best arch distribution. It’s a mistery to me why this is not the the number one arch distribution here at the top.Nice looking out of the box. Sane defaults, the most used tools and apps. Whenever I want a Linux computer up and running in no time, this is my choice.Tried many other arch based and Debian based but none of them to my liking.Nice work but as a one-man effort this need to draw more attention and get some help to keep up and living. The only concern is sometimes upgrading breaks things but you can correct simply editing a couple of confit files. Easy prays. Not for newcomers tough."
2024,2022-08-31, Archcraft, 2022.07.18,7,2,"First, I liked the good design and pre-installed themes, they looked so nice out of the box.But then I found some problems, maybe not from Archcraft itself, but from polybar in openbox, the tray icons are shown on fullscreen, youtube, gaming, etc.The support is... somewhat absent. I do not recommend it for daily draving a work machine, but you can always try it on a VM or live enviroment.It is a good effort from the developer, they managed to gather nice looks out of the box.Maybe give it some time, and it will be production ready."
2025,2022-08-23, Archcraft, 2022.07.18,3,10,"Sorry, I can't recomend this distro. I'm rating it as 3/10, so, there is almost no pros I can point. The distro has pretty theme visuals and that is it. You can, however, download and install its themes in another distro, so, you don't need to use Archcraft in order to get the same visuals.Unfortunately, I had many cons about the distro. The main one is the lack of official support when you are in trouble. Most of times you are by your own, there is no official support regarding technical problems, like dual monitor support, bugs after new features added, hidpi support and enterprise wi-fi connection. All of these problems are ignored, the distro only receives new theming features instead of fixes, which seem not be the priority.The distro is also not user friendly as it seems to be in the screenshots. In 3 weeks using it, many bugs and issues are not solved via updates, but by manually editing a lot of config files, scripts and complex stuff that a new comer can potentially break the entire system if done incorrectly.Unfortunately, with this many problems, I can't recomend the distro for now."
2026,2022-08-15, Archcraft, 2022.07.18,8,1,"This distribution is very good, but it has its problems. I'll start with the point that I consider to be the most interesting. This distro is really light. My laptop with an old HDD boots in between 25-30 seconds. For comparison, another computer of mine with Windows 10 and a modern HDD takes more than 1 minute to boot. I currently have Archcraft installed on an Acer Aspire 5920 laptop, Intel Core 2 duo T5550, 2GB DDR2. It works great, when I don't open any programs, the system consumes between 500-600mb of RAM with OpenBox. Now, on other positive points, the distro already comes with compositor, polybar, rofi and Atril. Now, about the negative points, the system's default text editor is Geany, which doesn't work well for me with Python and HTML/CSS, sometimes the shutdown button disappears or doesn't work and I need to shut down the computer through the command 'shutdown', the lock screen requires the password to be entered very quickly and the PT-BR translation is missing on some occasions. Despite these issues, I believe that the points outweigh the negatives and that this is the best distro I could install on my laptop."
2027,2022-07-21, Archcraft, 2022.07.18,10,7,"I have been ricing my Arch for a while now however it is very time consuming and how I wish I could find a distro that would have a set of carefully curated themes that would suit my taste. I was very surprised in finding out that Archcraft does so and a whole lot more than that. I will be sticking with this distro for a while. I would rate it 10/10 for being such a minimal distro with all the developer tools that I need, pretty and i mean PRETTY desktop environment which provides the polished out of the box feeling (rarely seen this with any distros if ever). It gave me that feeling of finding Ubuntu for the first time back when it was first introduced. This distro does it, and it does it really well. Please consider donating as I think this is a single person's effort and he/she would deserve all the donation to keep this project going."
2028,2022-07-08, Archcraft, 2022.06.08,10,0,"This flavor is a great way to learn how to configure your system, before taking the deep dive into installing Arch from the ground up. It's a fun way to learn how Openbox works if you're new to it. The developer provides nice, and easy to edit themes, and scripts to configure to your liking, these configs are also portable. The only thing I can see happening, as I see with every other Arch based GNU/LINUCKS flavor, is having a single dev / very small team, is the project going under due to dev burn out. It's possible, but this looks like a labor of love and the dev seems like a nice person. It has my favorite packages installed out of the box.

It is based on Arch (instead on Debian), so everything is fresh and new. Minimal, yet polite and functional system and desktop. I was really surprised, how it is customisable. It has many preinstalled themes, settings, conkys, and so on...yet it doesn't completely suit you, it won't bring things like on a gold tray.

I have mixed feelings with this distro. It comes with Kde but no Wayland option on the ssd. It only comes with the Xorg option and Xorg doesn't work on my hardware. On an old imac it did work without problems, but you have to be an experienced linux user: the installer is very confusing (very very confusing), the terminal opens by default in root mode sometimes (other times not), when you change the language By default, the desktop is unconfigured with new folders in your native language.Sometimes there are problems with the repositories; it works day in and day out.It does not have a website and the developer (or developers?) are not identified. I know that in the Linux world it is common, but it is a bit scary, really.I would never use it as a main system, but as a system to make the desktop look nice."
2062,2023-02-20, Bluestar Linux, 6.1.12,1,8,"To be honest that would be a -1 if it was available. While the distro is stable and does provide a good selection of software out of the box there is plenty to dislike about the distro. First the devs NEVER get back to you on anything. Second as mentioned by others no out of the box package manager. Third finding the right calamaries folder with the right partition.conf to edit to make Bluestar use BTRFS instead of EXT4 takes forever. Fourth processes that should require one to enter their password never ask for it, including updates. Fifth the save dialog you get when saving items through your browser is not the default that comes with KDE and is missing several key features it should have. I would strongly recommend people looking for a good daily driver avoid Bluestar Linux at all cost."
2063,2023-02-15, Bluestar Linux, 6.1.9,3,4,"The distro does not come with a GUI based package manager, and the konsole commands to install apps is not something any new linux user would ever know how to do properly. If there is a GUI installer hiding in here, then it is hidden really well. I've gotten no help from the BlueStar support page, and there is nothing online that seems to fix this mess. If I can't figure out how to install apps or system drivers, how in the world am I ever supposed to enjoy switching to linux in any regard?Outside of all that, the distro comes with some amazing applications on its own for offline install, and it would be a great distro, if only there was a package manager that was actually helpful."
2064,2023-02-12, Bluestar Linux, 6.1.9,5,0,"My experience in installing from the live environment was a pain. I use BTRFS for my file system and had to ask what the passwords for user and root were in the live environment. On top of this doing a search for the calamaries folder so I could edit partition.conf found almost 20 folders named calamares, so it took some time to fine which was the correct folder to find the version of partition.conf to edit. Then I ended up having to hunt down a video on how to install cause the terminal that launches shortly after the install starts to show you what extras are going to be installed errors out. Once on the desktop was forced to have to install ArcoLinux Spices so I could install ArchLinux Tweak Tool to be able to install the XeroLinux Welcome app so I could use it to fix the PGP keys. Once this was address installing software finally went smoothly. Another issue is that you cannot right click the desktop and create folders, links, etc. If you drag something to the desktop it creates a icon instead of asking you what you want to do. The last issue is the fact that they have the main user set up on 1001 instead of the 1000 they should be set up as. I for one like the amount of apps and the amount of customization that comes with Bluestar, but it is not without issues that just don't exist in other Arch based distros."
2065,2023-01-20, Bluestar Linux, 6.1.5,4,1,"I don't like to give up so I went back in the room with trying to install Bluestar on 2 different computers (both on external drives...1 is a 1 tb ssd & the other a 500gb sata).  I tried with the ventoy & it went the same as the previous failures but I figured the problem with with the updates that don't go through & freeze at 94 percent.  I may have written 91 percent before but I closed out the box & it finished.  In the mean time I used the old dd way of copying a fresh iso to a 32 gb flash drive & used that only to find it did the same as the ventoy flash drive.  I let it go through the failed updates and rebooted.   It had installed the basic.  I spent most of today importing various apps from the other arch linux distros I have running & got the vpn, clamtk, firewalld & other software on the working external ssd.  octopi does not work.  I put bauh on the bluestar & it works.  I will rate the distro higher if it survives my using it in the next few weeks.  It has potential as I said earlier in a review.  "
2066,2023-01-19, Bluestar Linux, 6.1.5,2,0,"I spent hours trying to make Bluestar work right on multiple computers.  One is a lenevo y70-70 touch gen 4 i7 laptop.  I tried the basic, desktop and dev versions.  Finally gave up after the systemsettings didn't work.  I couldn't bring the settings up at all.  Things that went wrong with other installations included the live installer (tried from dvd & usb flash drives) were freezing at 91 percent and the installation failing in the packages.  So many things went wrong.  Sad here because it has lots of potential.  I used manjaro, endeavour and reborn os (my latest) as well as garuda.  They work beautifully compared to Bluestar.  I give this os a 2 for beauty.  I tried both the 6.1 & the latest 6.15 before calling it ""quits"".  Another minus is there isn't much help."

And so does any other derivative using pacman.  I do not believe ""pacman"" is installed.  How do I get it installed?The other problem I have is the Bluestar install overwrote the grub file for the other OS installed on this laptop.  So I could not run it either.I do like the appearance of Bluestar and it's speed at booting-up on an older Dell Ultrabook.  And I like the easy access to almost everything I might ever need on a laptop.  I really missed the workspaces that went away some years back with other distro's.The one other complaint is ""workspace"" backgrounds.  It seems they are still at one-choice for all.  I would have thought that by now, the different workspaces would have multiple backgrounds for choices so you could tell which background is up just by the background shown.I like it so far."

I downloaded and tried Berry Linux yesterday.I am very impressed by the fact that they compress a 2 gig img into less than 1/2 a gig. This is clearly more economically viable than a massive iso, for the end user at least.But that's all I can say about Berry Linux, because it won't boot.I installed it to a flash drive using balenaEtcher. It would not boot.I installed it to a flash drive using Ventoy. It would not boot.I installed it to a flash drive using the dd command in terminal. It would not boot.It did not recognize my hardware.This was not a problem when trying Fedora 36, and never has been a problem with any previous versions of Fedora.My computer is a Dell Inspiron 15 3000 that came with Ubuntu 18.04 OEM. It's made to be compatible with Linux.Berry Linux is based on Fedora; so what have they done to make it so unusable?This gives me good reason to stick with Fedora. All of their 'spins' are effectively in-house, and they all work.Berry Linux seems to be trying to do what happens in the anarchic Debian/Ubuntu ecosphere, where there are distros based upon distros which are based upon distros.That there are very few Fedora based spin-offs is quite telling. All Fedora 'spins' are created within and maintained by the Fedora community.Berry Linux seems to be yet another vanity distro, that happens to be accidentally based upon Fedora.Don't blame Fedora for this one."

2085,2023-07-26, Qubes OS, 4.1.2,1,0,"
Concept seems good but I wasn't able to install it on a test laptop, seems to have a lot of bugs in the installer and severe hardware compatibility limitations, including some very basic issues: it seems wasn't able to write any changes to the partition table, so the first installation said it was complete, but on reboot it couldn't find a boot device. Thereafter it couldn't delete any partitions on the HDD. This seems a very basic bug  Maybe with more development it will become a viable option for a desktop, but given the bugs encountered, can't imagine it would be trustworthy enough for production use."
2086,2023-04-29, Qubes OS, 4.1.2,9,8,"Qubes has been my main OS for over five years, and I have found it to be a reliable foundation for software development. I appreciate the time and skill put into the production of Qubes OS: it is a well tested and carefully documented tool. At first I had a negative impression of Qubes OS because it seemed to put obstacles between me and what I wanted to get done. But eventually I learned how to use it and gained an understanding of the security problem that it solves. By partitioning the OS into separate domains, a kind of ablative resilience is achieved. If one virtual machine gets compromised, you can just throw it away.Qubes requires a conceptual grasp of how computer software works. You don’t have to be a programmer to use it, but if you aren’t then expect to spend some time building up the prerequisite knowledge for using Qubes."
2087,2023-03-19, Qubes OS, 4.1.2,10,10,"Qubes  allows for the compartmentalization of many distributions into sandboxed ""Qubes"". It is probably the best operating system for the privacy conscious and provides superior security when compared to almost any other OS. The most recent versions have made leaps and bounds towards making the UI more pleasing for the average user. Some of the other benefits of Qubes include:Security: Qubes OS offers strong security features, including compartmentalization of different computing tasks and processes in separate virtual machines. This means that if one application or process is compromised, the damage is limited only to that particular virtual machine, and not to the entire system.Privacy: Qubes OS is designed with privacy in mind, and provides users with tools to control and manage their personal data. Users can set up separate virtual machines for different types of data and tasks, such as banking, social media, and email, which helps to prevent data leakage and unauthorized access.Flexibility: Qubes OS is highly customizable, and can be configured to meet the needs of a wide range of users. It supports a variety of virtualization technologies and can run on a wide range of hardware, making it suitable for both personal and professional use.Open source: Qubes OS is an open-source operating system, which means that its source code is available for anyone to inspect and modify. This provides users with greater transparency and control over their computing environment, as well as the ability to contribute to the development of the operating system.Community: Qubes OS has a vibrant and active community of users and developers who contribute to its ongoing development and support. This community provides users with access to a wealth of resources, including documentation, forums, and online tutorials."
2088,2022-07-20, Qubes OS, 4.1.0,10,57,"Well-documented, great community, serious approach to security and privacy.Were you ever curious but afraid:    – to click on that link in the email,    – to open that email attachment,    – to go to that shady-looking website,    – to install and run that suspicious program or even a virus,    – to insert that USB stick from someone untrusted?Wth Qubes you do it all securely in a disposable VM and your personal files are safe. The worst thing which might happen is that the disposable VM breaks.Do you want to be anonymous on the Internet? One of the best modern solutions, Whonix with disposable VM, is available on Qubes OS out of the box. Alternative solution would be Tails, but it’s much less convenient and requires to reboot your system each time.Were you ever experiencing that something breaks after an update or after installing some software? On Qubes OS only a virtual machine breaks in such cases, and it can be easily, securely backed up and restored with a few clicks. Even if you forgot to make a backup this time it’s possible to restore from automatic backups, which are preconfigured.Do you feel that your work is not well separated from your personal life on your machine? With Qubes OS, you can have separate, independent VMs for them. You start and stop them independently, they don’t interfere with each other. If one is damaged/compromised, the other one will still be fine. Of course, you can have (much) more than two enclaves like those with a unified, simple interface.Were you ever been concerned about opening your personal email (controlling numerous online accounts) in the same browser where you go to random websites? Actually, even when the browsers are different it can be a problem on a monolithic OS! On Qubes OS, you open those things in separate VMs, isolated with hardware, not software. It’s often better than physical (air-gap) isolation. Recommended by Snowden.Are you tired of managing tens of complicated passwords, or using a password manager relying on clipboard security? On Qubes OS, you can save all your passwords as plain text (in a dedicated offline VM) and securely copy them into the necessary fields (in other VMs) whenever needed. No viruses or ransomware will have access to them. You can also combine this approach with a password manager.Do you prefer a certain GNU/Linux distribution, but something forces you to use another one, or Windows? On Qubes you can run many Linux distributions at the same time with a unified, simple interface. That important Windows program should also work in the corresponding Windows VM.Do you feel concerned that some software you must run (or Windows itself) sends telemetry or unknown stuff to some servers outside of your control? On Qubes OS, you have a Firewall with a simple GUI enforcing any rules on any VM.Did you hear stories that cameras or microphones in your laptop can be switched on remotely by malicious actors without your consent? On Qubes OS, you choose which VM has access to the camera and microphone, or you choose none. The Admin VM has no Internet.Are you tired of entering your super-long root password every time you do something? On Qubes, you don’t need a root password at all, because security is enforced on a lower 1 level, level of hardware isolation. Just type sudo and run whatever you need."
2089,2022-06-29, Qubes OS, 4.1.0,10,44,"This is the system you need if you require a secured OS. The isolation system with VMs allow to separate casual and secured environment. The netVM and firewall VM allow you to separate some VMs from the internet if you don't link them to any netVM. You can attach some VMs to Tor netVM, so you can be sure no traffic will go out of Tor. The VM management interface is good and the management of the system is not so hard if you read the good documentation. You can also copy some files from VM to VM or from external drives to VMs. In my view the only default is the update / upgrade process which can be a little technical and long. But again the documentation is good and updated."
2090,2022-06-20, Qubes OS, 3.2.1,9,25,"Quebes is without a doubt the most secure system you can get up to date. But could not make it more simple and easy to make work, for an inexperienced computer user, as I would like to set up Perrot in this system. Can open Qubes, but can not get the network to work on my computer with Qubes ? Have driven a bit to everything and prefer Mint, Perrot. Backbox and Septor. Running Tor Browser works very slowly even though it should be a safe way to be safe. Have instead run through port 9050 which seems effective for firefox and without problems in Mint."
2091,2022-06-15, Qubes OS, 4.1.0,9,8,"I've noticed the attacks on my system are becoming increasing sophisticated and though I've survived decades in the microelectronic/computer field without appreciable damage through a lot of careful effort it seems only a matter of time before my luck runs out. (And I would suspect a more typical computer user is substantially more susceptible to an attack than me.) For this reason I've switched to Qubes as it is clearly the most secure OS available (versus ""Tails"" for privacy). The big issue, besides finding compatible hardware, is that its use demands an advanced to expert user to really get the most out of it. If unable to read the documentation, be able to fill in the missing blanks, and take the time to troubleshoot/setup I'd recommend taking another path.It would be great if the Qubes development team implemented a system check to see what will or will not work on your system before an install. It may be possible to get it to work on the hardware you have and the Qubes forum may help, but it can still take a lot of time and energy too. When it works, it's brilliant."
2092,2022-06-14, Qubes OS, 4.1.0,10,6,"Qubes is the most secure open-source endpoint in the world. It is used to protect anyone who needs to mask their traffic, work with untrustworthy files or anyone with a serious threat model. This system is not for the faint of heart but is a relatively simple transition for linux admins who already are familiar with concepts of virtualization and tor independently. End users without a linux background would be best advised to use TAILS as an alternative as there is more space for technical and operational mistakes in a persistent or semi-persistent environment. If you need a full-time OS to work in a max-security environment, this should be your main candidate."
2093,2022-05-30, Qubes OS, 4.1.0,10,10,"Qubes has been a great privacy and security focused distro. I would highly recommend this distro if you’re worried about governments and other bad actors spying on your online activities and reporting everything you to do to be held against you.This distro has been becoming easier to use and not as difficult to use than it use to be a long while back. The forum is active, developers are active, there is a great response time for any patches and bugs to be fixed, the distro is pretty stable, speedy and works flawlessly."
2094,2022-04-22, Qubes OS, 4.1.0,8,6,"My admiration and gratitude for the Qubes developers.Beautiful setup for privacy.I used 4.0 and was put off because suspend was outright drama for me and couldn't get it going on my desktop.Hoped that 4.1 would correct this but unfortunately in remained the same drama.I am a FreeBSD user and run separate VM's with puppy as skeleton OS for my internet connections.From this point of view as a feedback: 1- the documentation I find confusing , codes written in between text. The FreeBSD handbook is very clear in explaining so I hope the team will follow this example layout. Same for the forum.2- please fix the suspend, I use the desktop around 6 hours a day and don't like to power off and boot again which takes a long time.3- using 4.1 there was a XEN update and was unable to boot. The solution was too complicated for me to spend time on it and left Qubes for what it was.I will continue to monitor Qubes forum and website till I see bugs (2 and 3) are improved and go back to Qubes.All over it is a beautiful setup and definitely the best in security and privacy"
2095,2022-04-20, Qubes OS, 4.1.0,7,5,"First of all, QUBES is a fantastic 'distro' maintained and built by dedicated people and I thank them.I have to say however that the latest stable version has a ton of bugs.  The QUBES forums will show this.  4.0 was stable and, for me, virtually trouble free.  The latest release can be painful and require reboots that aren't quick with a system like this.  Having said that, I will continue to use QUBES as my daily driver.Despite the above issues I would highly recommend QUBES and suggest that it is so far ahead of the other distros for security you can't beat it and I am sure that the bugs will get ironed out with updates."
2096,2022-03-23, Qubes OS, 4.1.0,5,0,"The idea is great. The implementation makes user experience troublesome. Makes one thing of using a type 2 hypervisor with maximally clean host instead.I do realize that it's more difficult to configure Xen to run smoothly. I personally faced two following difficulties:1. I tried 4.0 and 4.1 on a machine with 12 GB RAM that had an HDD. The RAM seemed to be enough. But it was extremely slow. I think because it has no SSD. Alright. That's understandable and is mentioned in the system's requirements. By the way, 4.1 seemed to run better and faster.2. I tried 4.1 on a machine with 16 GB and an NVMe. Well, tried to try it. It failed to boot. It was impossible to set up the machine with NVMe only to have MBR parition / work in Legacy Boot mode. Following the Legacy mode would make it flawless (as I did in the first machine). And it ended up having nothing to boot after the system was installed. I tried a couple of tricks in recovery mode. Nothing really helped. I might be impatient. Sorry! But that's not a good start to me. I have no much time to tinker with making efforts to get it just booting. It's a pity. I really wanted to try it on hardware that meets the requirements."
2097,2022-02-09, Qubes OS, 4.1.0,10,37,"It does exactly what it sets out to do: provide a secure computing experience. It strikes a good balance between convenience and security which is difficult to do. Resources are also being spent on making GPU pass through and GUI domains more user friendly, this will make Qubes very appealing to a wide audience once they are stable."
2098,2022-01-06, Qubes OS, 4.0.4,9,16,A fabulous OS with great features to protect user privacy but at the same time is not compatible with all kinds of hardware. Hence 9 starts instead of 10.
2099,2021-12-25, Qubes OS, ,10,0,"Absolute fantastic concept and excellent OS! Only important thing is having compatible hardware.This is especially true if one really takes the security aspect seriously by e.g. securing the entire boot chain with Secure Boot by e.g. your BIOS should be able to secure Grub and XEN images (if one wants to trust Intel ME). Same is true for its free alternatives as Libreboot, Coreboot or Google NERF. I do not want to focus that much on privacy and security as previous posts seem to mix up those topics with attributes not related to Qubes, but to the templates available which IMHO confuses more then it helps, e.g. the post from 2021-11-22 highlights ""I only use Windows through Qubes because I want my privacy respected and to not have my info sold to companies to spam me with ads and other creepy behavior."". While this might be true, it related to the whonix Tor gateway and has nothing to to with Qubes OS itself. One could or probably should consider Pi-Hole or such tools for such a purpose.I also recommend to try to understand the concept of Qubes and Linux in general before deriving a false conclusion on the security and/or privacy of the system as it adds and additional layer of complexity for the virtualization with XEN and probably even more defined by the amount of different templates used as some might use different init system coming along with different risks etc.Therefore I would suggest one should at least be able to e.g. build its own Linux based on e.g. Gentoo stage 3 to ensure at lease a basic understanding of a Linux OS itself. Otherwise one might feel more secure only because Qubes is more obscure to them then other OS sole due to it increased complexity. But well, just my humble 2 cent."
2100,2021-12-06, Qubes OS, 4.0.4,9,25,"Qubes isn't a distro, but more of a hypervisor implementation that can run many isolated, compartmented distributions. I'm a slackware enthusiast, but am familiar with the two default distributions that are included with the qubes install. If you're up for getting an adequate working knowledge of the debian and fedora distributions then you'll likely enjoy qubes. The generic install includes Whonix (debian based) which appears to have some impressive security credentials. However, Whonix does not yet support Qubes R4.1beta so there are a few noticeable hiccups during routine operation of disposable VMs and updates. But these should be resolved soon. I do enjoy the Qubes implementation and my review will be a 10 once the Whonix-16 compatability issues are addressed. Since the technical depth placed on this software (qubes, whonix, debian, fedora) is great, I have to trust the developers are of high integrity. A good sign is the primary developers don't hide behind monikers. I have gained a good level of trust in them primarily because of their level of participation in responding to issues. These people are sharp.All this being said, disposable whonix virtual machines rock. I'm expecting to go the long haul on this project. My Slackware VM is almost ready for prime time."
2101,2021-11-22, Qubes OS, 4.0.4,10,42,"This is the best distro for complete privacy and anonymity. Programs work well and there aren’t a lot of programs installed by default, which is great- you can install more programs from the repositories and add more repositories for even more programs to choose from, customization and such as well. It takes some getting used to and learning, but trust me, it’s worth it! It’s very easy to set up virtual machines for running other operating systems, including Windows.

The privacy and security you get on Qubes is unmatched, it definitely keeps everything private and your communications safe. Lots of applications to choose from and I agree with others- I can basically say if you’re in a country where the government spies on everything you do and say, this is an excellent distro to get them to butt out of your life."

Others have already covered how good this distro is in detail, but I’d like to say something extra.In my home country of Venezuela, you probably heard what’s going on here, this has been keeping me safe and my internet browsing private so all of us “anti-regime” people can communicate safely and securely with each other.I definitely recommend using Qubes, and Edward Snowden uses it too, that’s definitely a good thing I can say.10 out of 10"

I must say, for now after 3 weeks of testing, I'm very happy with Qubes and the smart architecture designed.In comparison to Gentoo, Qubes requires much less Linux and gcc knowledge and is way more accessible for new users while I would still not recommend it for beginners. At least if the ""beginner"" is not knowledgeable in operating system architecture and virtualization in general.Great OS to learn more about XEN and virtualization in general. For understanding operating system elements as kernel, initramfs, init systems and such, I would still recommend Gentoo (or another LFS). In my opinion the best way to learn by far."
2107,2021-08-04, Qubes OS, 4.0.4,10,23,one of best distros for anonymty and security on internet!
2108,2021-06-04, Qubes OS, 4.0.4,10,35,"One year ago, I installed Qubes on a Purism Librem 13 and have been using it as my daily driver ever since.At first, my experience with the workflow in Qubes was like entering an alien world. As with anything new and wonderful, once I became better acquainted with it, I was in awe. I’ll be contrarian here and suggest that even non-technical users will be able to get the hang of Qubes and reap its enormous benefits.Among those benefits, Qubes can be configured (by a pro) to safeguard the average office worker from the most frequent security threats. For emails, all links and attachments can be set to open in an isolated disposable virtual machine (VM), which completely neuters most phishing attacks. Attachments can even be edited and saved in a separate disposable VM, never exposing the user to the open document. Similarly, web browsing in a separate VM limits the effectiveness of drive by downloads.We all know Qubes for its security, but there are also huge benefits for internet privacy. Qubes makes it easy to obscure tracking by making it effortless to use numerous IP addresses with multiple instances of VPNs and Tor running simultaneously. Qubes can even help users thwart pesky browser fingerprinting by using VMs to create as many different browsers (and fingerprints) as they wish.Computing is at a crossroads. One path leads to a land of self-determination with reasonably secure computers that users control; the other path ends in dystopia where malware and tracking are just part of the landscape within the walled garden. I hope Qubes is the future we choose.Note: If you stray from the Qubes Hardware Compatibility List (HLC), you will likely be met with frustration and disappointment. Before you buy hardware, you might want to seek out and study three great videos from 2018 to get a sense of the peculiar workflow in Qubes. Search for Qubes videos from Micah Lee, Konstantin Ryabitsev, and Matty McFatty."

So funny how people declare that they finally have found a daily driver, the best, or life time distro, and they are so proud of themselves . . . until it fails. Then it is back to the dance once more. Something is fundamentally wrong with this process when users dance literally for years just looking for an OS that works. Try, fail, stumble, fall, and crash. These are the primary distro dance steps. "

Surprisingly,  this Alpha testing version is, thus far, the most compatible and stable on this machine. In the beginning I had to boot Legacy and modify kernel parameters to get qubes to play nice, but now (since 4.03 and beyond) Qubes boots UEFI right out of the starting gate.No mods at all!Qubes is always a little behind on the compatibility curve when it comes to modern hardware so the best way to start is to look at the HCL page on Qubes website and a pick hardware that shows the level of support you desire."

The boot time is noticeably longer than other distros I have tried, but it's still not bad at all - system is ready in less than 10 seconds.I like the KDE Plasma interface as it is very familiar and I have had no issues with usability. I have been able to find everything, and so far everything is running very smoothly.Hopefully this is the last stop on the distro hopping train for me. So far, so good."

For example it uses the older lockscreen, which might not be as pretty as the new one but it is faster to load certainly, it ships with zswap installed too which is good if you run it on older hardware.OpenSUSE is also great but tends to run slower on my hardware, it boots slower too, KDE Neon is great but also unstable even in its user edition with lots of unresolved bugs because they just take things from Canonical, and all Ubuntu distros (except Mint) they prefer Snap over .deb. It's a choice and i respect the direction but i can't say snap is better as of now.Pros:- Debian 11 base is very good- Excalibur Menu is the best KDE launcher: doesn't chug as the new kickoff and it has slightly more than the classic menu.- it opened every media file i had out of the box.Cons:- old KDE version (not a deal breaker but you have to accept to give up on the newest little features like color accents or the new overview)- I had some difficulty setting up my printer despite HPLIP was installed by default."

I'm not a ""technical"" user, so maybe that's a clue.  Neptune seems more polished, complete, and final like a commercially released operating system would be, and more comforting to an average home computer user.I'm certainly not criticizing the others, but when I sit down and decide which drive to boot, it's almost always Neptune now.Bravo and many thanks to the Neptune developers !"

I want to note the amount of preinstalled multimedia software on Neptune by default, and understandably, this is a good thing for some, especially those who are digital media hobbyists and I respect that, you've got several video players/editors, audio editors and image viewers/editors... but for the vast majority of typical day-to-day users, I feel like the amount of media software included is a little much and you'd probably only need 1, maybe 2 video players, an image viewer or editor, and that should cover it.

2135,2021-12-08, Neptune, 6.5,10,1,"Thanks for this excellent review. I have used Neptune since version 6.0 and findthe aesthetics to be about as good as they can be on a graphical OS interface.I particularly like the ""Grau"" theme on the Neptune Grub presentation. Blocking off the text in red boxes is very appealing in my opinion. I have what most would consider a huge array of Linux distributions on my three-disk configuration, andalways enjoyed returning to use the Neptune 6.5 with the Plasma 5 desktop. Iprimarily use the Simple Menu, which is not always present as a default menu""Alternative"" with a right click on the menu button. I actually swap out a fourth drive sometimes wit a SATA to USB cable adaptor cable and sometimes I need to switch out drives in order to enjoy a favorite Distribution. Neptune has been reliable but somewhat slow in booting, but I do look forward to a future Neptune release,hopefully based on Debian Bullseye. I would do a fresh install to ensure I enjoy the experience of a fully branded OS. Upgrading is always a possibility but ofcourse could result in the loss of some of the beautiful aesthetics. I'm using a DellOptiplex 9020 with four cores, 3700 Mhz top processing speed, and an IntelXeon E3-1200  graphics card.

I'm running on an old Mac book 4.1 from 2010 with an Intel dual core processor clocking at 2.4ghz and 2gb ram. All in all its nice to have debian back. Kde desktop is awesome too.

The installation was simple, but after install when clicking ""Finish"" it went to everlasting loading.. I forced my laptop to turn off and turned it on. Once I entered the distro I felt it fresh and light. Neptune turned out to be an excellent distro. It works. No questions. It just works and it works perfectly. Feels very polished and light.

2139,2023-07-09, Kumander Linux, 1.0,9,1,"
A distro that nails it target audience fully.  Essentially Kumander fulfills the promise of Linux Lite by creating a out of the box completely intuitive and functional desktop for non-technical Windows refugees,  Not only is this distro perfect for Windows users but comes in on the low end of the middle weight distros, running Live at 485 MB of RAM (wit wifi running) on old hardware .The shock to me was how fast Kumander is, running circles around the heavier MX Linux.    I have some reservations about this as potentially being a one man sop distro,one that just missed being able to come out wit 5 years of support (Debian 12) vs the 3 years remaining on Debian 11.I also could not apply the updates, I am not sure if that ad to do wit Live mode or not, but given i could download other apps and run them I tend to think it may be a bug.  For Windows users transitioning to Linux this is The Distro.  My only caveat is I would use TAILS or Porteus for sensitive financial transactions until this distro demonstrates appropriate updating.This is a job well done.  Light on resources, fast as can be. and totally intuitive  for Windows users.   Kumander nails its target, a perfect bullseye.  "
2140,2023-07-05, Kumander Linux, 1.0,8,2,"I tried it before the 1st release came out and it looks very nice.It is (mostly, or completely?) done by 1 person and I hope this project will get some more help or joins up with another distro, taking all the good things with it.Perhaps ZorinOS ? Or some other distro that caters to the same crowd.There are lots of people that still run Windows 7 and a distro to bring them into the realm of Linux could be of great use for them. Mostly also because their Hardware is not so new either.I hope it will have a bright future.

I tried to use  Ubuntu Studio gain, after past not the best  experiences with Audio Studio.This time version 22.10.The whole OS is fine, the preinstalled packages might be useful for graphics and video production, but audio part of it is useless. From a professional audio production point of view. I understand the postponed move towards PipeWire audio structure. It is immature, and unreliable for audio production using pro Audio/MIDI interfaces. However, the Ubuntu Studio Audio Package with Studio Controls interface is a total mess.Being a pro audio engineer, using many pro audio production applications and hardware, Pro Tools licensed, composer, musician, etc, etc... I have never figured out how to properly setup the Studio Controls with ridiculously over-complicated structures of Pulse-Jack-ALSA-tweaks--bridges-backends-devices-childish looking mixers-etc, etc... I have never made my audio interfaces work. The online instructions on Ubuntu Community Help Wiki is old, and it does not reflect the current Studio Controls interface.Yes, I finally found the way to make my audio interface work: I uninstalled the whole Audio Studio Package (sic!!!).

The install works fine with no issues.  It has all the apps that one could want except the above ones that I mentioned.The KDE Distro is new to me as I usually use Gnome (Coming from Fedora 35).  It is a very smart Desktop indeed as the icons are very well done and the color systems brilliant and well thought out.  I like that one can program different corners to do different things.  Brilliant.Thanks for a wonderful Distro.

Previously I was using 20.04 which was also quite nice distro, but KDE adds a special flavor making it even better. Dolphin is VERY useful FM, probably the best in Linux world. Adding icons for most common programs to KDE taskbar by default was also a nice touch - saves me time when I boot the distro on another shared PC and it looks and feels great with default dark theme. No bugs or glitches so far, works with Asus Xonar sound card right out of the box (I just had to switch alsamixer to multichannel), all drivers recognized and installed automatically. It's very good to see Krita 5 included and all other awesome creative apps in their newest versions...IMHO Ubuntu Studio is objectively the best Linux distro overall for creative and general use and professionally maintained in a safe and secure manner.

The installation took 30 min (SSD) - no problems - and another half hour to customize.  Change an older (or new) computer into a multimedia studio in less than an hour.While some might complain there are too many programs - just create a favorites list and use a launch bar.

Voyager makes Debian more stable and easy to configure: codecs, for example. Voyager makes Gnome a pretty and practical desktop. I have not had any problems installing Voyager Debian 12 and no bugs in the first few hours of use. Good job Voyager!On occasions I had tried other distros that make Debian easier and faster to configure, such as SolydK, but I prefer this distro because it takes care of the aesthetic aspect, something that neither Debian nor its friendly distros usually do."

Voyager needs to put out a xfce version again without the gnome garbage.  I switched from ubuntu to x ubuntu in 2011 to get rid of the new gnome.  XFCE and many distros are trying to become windows and are so tied up in this they are puting out garbage.

Voyager is an interesting distro for some of the little tweaks here and there.  I like the conky and the conky configuration ability right on the desktop panel.  I like the feel of the wallpapers.  I like the OS' stability (Debian base).  I like most things about this distro... except Gnome.  Gnome is the one problem I have with this distro.  It bogs down my system (uses too many system resources).  Running a 16 GB RAM Dell, and Gnome should have enough memory, but it glitches, freezes, the screen flashes black and then comes back, there are errors about panels...  A lot of problems.  When I use Voyager, I install it and go into non-GUI mode long enough to install Cinnamon or Xfce.  Then it works beautifully.  With Cinnamon, you can get all the little tweaks and interest that makes Voyager great to use, but there is something about the Gnome DE that is just unstable on my systems (I've it on two computers running Voyager with Cinnamon perfectly and a third computer running Voyager with Xfce because of lower memory).  Having to install another GUI is why I rate this 5/10.  A newbie that boots this up on a computer without the latest and greatest hardware would probably have problems and would not have the knowledge and skill to go terminal mode and install another GUI.  If Voyager would be adventurous and voyage out to other lands of interfaces (ooh puns) as offerings, it would be more accessible for more people.  My suggestion would be to offer Cinnamon, Xfce and Mate or Trinity versions in addition to Gnome.  That would broaden the field of potential users and probably increase stability for those with hardware that gives Gnome indigestion (a problem I have seen a lot for computers that are over 5 years old)."

I also noticed that voyager-os does not use any deb-package which maintains the mods. I think the system got simply screwed / overwritten by some updates which break some of the mods?I also noticed the user-forum on voyagerlive.org is closed, the imprint doesn't give any hint who is responsible/maintainer and there even is no issue-tracker to report or discuss such problems.It looks nice,... but with such bugs I will never practically swich to this OS looking great at first glance :-("

Mabox is another Arch/Manjaro based distro that works great. The openbox window manager makes the system run very fast even on older computers. The system is well configured. There are many graphical tools to configure the system with the mouse instead of commands. I recommend this system as an introduction to the adventure with Arch Linuxen. I was not disappointed with this distribution. I am not able to find any serious flaws yet. I hope that I will stay on Maxbox longer. The LTS kernel is installed by default, so it should be stable. I recommend it again."
2171,2023-02-28, Mabox Linux, 23.02,7,1,"Mabox is a very neat & tidy distro, & easy to use, if you don't want to get under the hood.The tint2 & the panels are a bit messy, & are not easy to edit & configure. There is too much bling in the way, unlike with other Openbox fronted systems. There are too many unnecessary applications, that are effectively non-functional, because there's no apparent way to configure them, e.g., the weather forecast. There are too many applications that look flashy, but have no configuration options available.Oh yes, it's easy to change the colourisation or the theme, but all of this conceals the functionality.And there is a big negative.There is no battery power icon, which is essential for running a laptop.; & there seems to be no way of adding one to either tint2 or the multiple panels.The website claims that there is a battery indicator available, but it is invisible when the battery is fully charged.This is clearly not true, because I have been running my laptop on battery power for 90 minutes, yet no battery indicator has appeared.No battery indicator appears when it is charging, either.This is a major oversight by the developers.Mabox seems to be all about appearance.There are far better Openbox fronted systems I could mention that are aimed at user friendliness, that can be easily user customised.Also, there is far less FLOSS available, but that's probably because most developers will usually have a .deb or .rpm available, but not bother making one for the Arch family.Mabox is very pretty, but doesn't come close to the usability of the Debian based Openbox distros."
2172,2023-02-07, Mabox Linux, 23.01,10,17,"Even though Mabox is basically Manjaro or Arch one thing clearly stands out. Their implementation of ""Openbox"" WM is absolutely fantastic. I've never really liked using WM's and especially not ""Openbox"" but Mabox's useage of ""Openbox"" is outstanding. I ran it in a VM and from a flash drive and my usage was smooth and flawless. I installed it to one of my main PC's and was absolutely stunned. Everything worked from the instant it booted, no errors, no misconfigurations, no corrupted files just perfection. Everything was recognized right out of the box. Well done to the Mabox devs and contributors."

I am happy to come across it and installed it right away alongside two other os's.Since i was looking for replacement on my new partition i now have an amazing bootscreen and mabox recognized the other systems flawlesly. So a big thanks to the developers! I tried a lot of different distro's but Mabox is one that sticks out for sure.The openbox / taskbar combination makes it very easy to use. Mabox is really practicle and i keep coming back just for the looks.Although you can change the looks the default state is amazing, keeps me interested and nothing is boring in the layout. I love that! However, i tried a couple of Manjaro and other arch-based distros and again the look and feel of Mabox is the most pleasant one."

It's very fast - was not expecting that.  Major and minor details seem to be suited to my purposes.  Openbox is my new favorite.When the system updates, it keeps a number of versions (I think the default is 3) so as to not clog your partition with too many older versions.  Mabox is fast and streamlined like Puppy, and a full-fledged operating system like MX."

On the contrary, with the additions of many Mabox tools, you can save/restore sessions, pseudo tile your windows easily, have a stack of boilerplate texts, colorize your pyRadio and conkies (which can be used as cheat sheets for the many keyboard shortcuts), etc. Since it uses Openbox, it is free of Javascript and yet you have your Win key to invoke any launcher, using either Mabox jgmenus or rofi launcher. On the cons side, I just say that I would prefer it over ArchLinux and not on Manjaro, which has a rather slow breakable update system.  "

2180,2022-10-16, Mabox Linux, 22.09,10,10,"Hardware: Dell Inspiron 3583.This is a truly great OS. It's the closest I have found to the setup I had on Crunchbang. Maybe the developers think similarly to me. I haven't had to change any keyboard shortcuts. Super + w for default web browser. Super + f for file manager. I'll probably want to change a few, but Mabox makes that easy. Setting defaults is made so easy.Coming from an Ubuntu (initially) base & then a Debian base, I find Mabox to be even easier to operate. And most of the software that I want/use is in the Mabox repository.For certain (closed source) programmes, there is usually a .deb or .rpm available; but with Mabox I don't really need to use them any more. I used to use WPS Office on Debian, but I find that LibreOffice is so much better. (WPS is available from the AUR if you really want it).I am so glad that FLOSS is growing & becoming more accessible, more usable, more UTD (up-to-date as well as united).This may sound crazy, but I do see the possibility that M$W may start using the Linux kernel as its basis. There is a lot of cooperation going on.This leads me to make comparisons.Mabox is quite slow to boot (from an encrypted installation), but shutdown is almost like turning off a light. That is the the opposite of M$W.Mabox has updates on an almost daily basis, which is the opposite of Debian Stable, or even Ubuntu LTS, but a bit like M$W, the difference being that with Mabox (being based upon Arch/Manjaro) is latest & best, whereas M$W is always fighting a self-defence position against hostile hackers. But the (mostly unpaid) Linux volunteers sort out problems on a coffee break. remember the code issue with BASH? Sorted in less than an hour!I really like Debian. NASA use Debian, which is definite kudos. And the Debian based derivatives I have used have all been good.And likewise, I really like Ubuntu, although I do prefer the derivatives, which are usually short-lived.I killed an Arch install within 48 hours: my fault; I accept all responsibility.I killed a Manjaro install within 1 week:ditto: my fault; I accept all responsibility.Mabox doesn't let me do that. If something from the AUR is not compatible, then it will not install. That's fine. I don't have the time to spend time to be trying to make things fit. Mabox makes my life easier.Mabox is a great OS.I recommend Mabox.Thank you to the Mabox developers.And thank you to Distrowatch."

That being said, I could see myself using it on a more powerful and contemporary laptop or desktop too. A lot to like here, I just hope being based on Manjaro, which I used to love but of late, have found a little unstable, doesn't weigh it down. I do think choosing a LTS kernel is a sensible move, that should help with stability and I have to confess I do like PAMAC. "
2182,2022-09-06, Mabox Linux, 22.08,8,4,"8.9 score. Previous version did not work out of the box, but this one does. 1.So far LXLE distro has a quick switch wallpaper icon on the top left that has made it too be very nice distro. If this featurebe use for mabox, then it would leverage its popularity.2. Mx Linux attraction point is the ""snapshot"" iso feature that no other distro could on par so far, not even ""timeshift"" that comes near to that. So again, if the ""snapshot iso feature from Mx-linux"" be ported into mabox ? Timeshift can drop then.I had stability issues with EndeavourOS but not with this 22.08 mabox. If Mabox could follow ""Devuan"" not using systemd, it would be more scoring points in the future.Mabox, a great catching up distro the moments one tried it."
2183,2022-09-03, Mabox Linux, 22.08,10,34,"So first things first, why oh why are you reading this when you could be enjoying Mabox right now?10/10 well deserved and my reasons are listed below;1) Superb themes from the Lightddm login window all the way to every aspect of the desktop.2) Complete control over your system without bloat being forced onto you computer. You pick what you want using pacman from the terminal to install or using the provided GUI software installer. Pull in from Arch linux AUR to further enhance your experience.3) A solid up to date Kernel with option to move to even newer if that's what you prefer.4) In changing your wallpaper to which there are plenty to choose from your entire desktop pallet alters to match so no need to tinker to much trying to find the perfect colour to match your wallpaper.5) The really useful Mabox control center.6) The very useful keyboard shortcuts to your entire system so you use less mouse and more keyboard which is brilliant and quicker.7) A desktop that keeps out of your way.8) A Global menu using windows key/super and (M) to access software in a speedy way.9) A normal menu which on tapping the windows/super key will appear quickly.Overall this should really be higher in the distrowatch ranking and in my opinion above Manjaro, Ubuntu and Linux Mint.

2184,2022-08-31, Mabox Linux, 22.08,10,4,"Well, after a long time trying to decide the best distro for my ThinkPad, I think I found the one.Mabox is stable. Fast. Easy to configure and make a pretty desktop in just about 20 minutes or less.It differs itself from Manjaro, and it's trying to be something in the middle of Arch and Ubuntu. Imagine semi-rolling like Fedora, but with access to the Arch repositories (use AUR at your own risk, of course, as always).In my case, I just installed Plank, and was good to go :)It has many pre-installed themes, but you can make your own and save it, and use it on another installation!I cannot recommend Mabox enough. Give it a try"
2185,2022-08-24, Mabox Linux, 22.08,10,11,"Having never even heard of Mabox before, and looking for an Arch Linux based, Openbox fronted distro, I downloaded and tested it last weekend, and was immediately well impressed, enough to install it.Mabox is a very elegant distro, and very easy to use. the installation is very straight forward, and has the advantage of being installable offline. It is also one of the fastest installs I have ever encountered: about 15 minutes.I also consider it to be the best laid out Openbox fronted distro I have ever tried.For the more adventurous, the Arch User Repository is available, with appropriate warnings of system breakage.Having tried Manjaro before (Mabox can be described as a spin on Manjaro), I find Mabox to be much more stable.In this, I would recommend Mabox as an excellent starting point for users wanting to explore the 'Arch Way', without having to jump in at the deep end.Preferring to use my own folder names, rather than the defaults, I copied and pasted my 'user-dirs.dirs' file into '.config', which took immediate effect from relaunching pcmanfm.PROS:Rolling release means install once and continue to update, meaning no more point release issues, or even having to make a fresh install because the new release is incompatible with the previous version.As with all Arch Linux based distros, it is especially important to pay great attention to the system. Mabox makes this very easy, because it is very informative, which makes it very friendly towards newcomers to the Arch Linux universe.Being based upon Arch Linux, there is the availability of the almighty Arch Wiki, which is perhaps the best resource available for Linuxen users, regardless of distro. The Arch Linux Forum is also an excellent reference point (Just don't post questions that are not directly related to Arch Linux thereon. Mabox has its own forum).CON:If encrypting ones installation, using special characters in the password seems to default to the US keymap. Be aware of this. Learn the keymaps.ALL-IN-ALL:I would recommend Mabox as a distro for people who are new to the Linux base."

It ships with very few desktop applications, yet the menus are crowded with options. In my opinion Mabox has many configuration tools but they all seem to work, but the number of them (and the lack of a one central organization for them) can make it harder to find the options I want to adjust.

Noble but unrealistic. Too far behind to catch up without a miracle. In compatibility and market niche it is outclassed by your pick of Linux configurations. I believe it will never be more than a curiosity. Still, it deserves to exist for novelty and proof of concept.To be clear, from a pros perspective it's a noble idea and I like the thought of an open Windows, but I have to ask if windows was really meant to be open in the first place. It seems at every turn even from early on Microsoft has meant its design to be anti competition, and this is the result: something that can never be what Windows is, because Windows is the product of countless paid hours of development and volunteer hours to curb MS's edges and free mass market testing, with hardware leaning into its support and every whim when it wants to change something.So you get to the major con: ReactOS cannot catch up. It will never get the bug testers, the developers, or the impetuous to stand head to head with wherever Windows is running to. If Windows is replaced I think it will be by an innovative Linux implementation or something else that goes away from the Windows design mindset. Success requires innovation, not just reacting.If you want older compatibility you can use a carefully tuned linux setup or brave an older Windows, which is still more practical than React. If you are looking for a novelty to contribute to this is a neat idea, stay far away if you want a daily driver."

There are so many good Linux distros to choose from and with Microsoft finally cleaning up their own act you need to be a real waste of space to get flattened by using Windows.
2230,2021-12-18, ReactOS, 0.4.13,10,0,"Super cool project!Nobody else, from what I can tell, has dove into this realm.It is what it is... a work in progress and I can't wait for the final product.Super lite, blazing fast and fun to play with."

2232,2021-11-14, ReactOS, 0.4.13,9,14,"An interesting take on an OS for ReactOS trying to be compatible with Windows. I understand it’s lagging behind a lot, I can say because of funding compared to what Microsoft has a budget for, but I see it’s admirable for ReactOS to exist and try its best to be compatible. With some older games I have, they have worked pretty well.I do hope for more coming from this because I think the developers are doing a great job."
2233,2021-11-03, ReactOS, 0.4.13,5,0,"Ok, I had to come back and write a review as I have tested this OS so many times and it NEVER booted past a black screen. Well folks I have just had it booted up on my AMD FX 8 CORE WITH 24GB RAM and it flies!It is such a shame that it is still looking like it is win 3.1, it has no email software, no internet, and no firewall all of which is necessary in today's world. I have to admire the guys who have kept working on it and it was fun to see if it worked, but it is not a viable alternative to any of the mainstream Linux distros with all the software that is available for them.But I am happy that I have at least seen it running in live mode (CD), who knows what the future will bring for this OS!Until then I will keep testing it when new updates appear."

Both Linux and Windows gonna get some real competition. Love the idea and concept. However, progression seems to be moving VERY slowly. And it's barly useable. If it keeps moving this slow. People gonna give up on it. And the project will most likely shut down. Sad. "
2235,2021-02-08, ReactOS, 0.4.13,2,0,"Identical to server 2003Outdated browser support, no driver support for mobile computers, poor power management. Everything you expect out of server 2003, but """"""not windows""""""it works when you install it, i guess. "

I admire the fact that they have continued to keep working on it regardless of some of the problems they have faced. This latest version I burned to a USB key and tried to boot the system. Unfortunately, it still does not boot even in debug mode, it just hangs at the system 32 screen.So I will keep coming back to test it and hopefully, it will boot off a USB key one day.Until then keep up the good work and I like the new website."
2237,2021-01-01, ReactOS, 0.4.13,8,19,"Honestly, I would love to see a new open source Windows alternative SUCCEED. I played with ReactOS a few years ago and at that time, it looked very promising.The problem is when I finally tried it again this week, I was extremely disappointed to see that it really has not moved very far forward. It looks like an antiquated version of Windows and really looks very little changed in 5 years.I would love to see this project succeed (and have even donated to help the project a few times in the past), But if you ever want to be a system that can even sort of compete with Windows, you need to catch up with the emerging technology that Windows is using.

This little distro is wonderful! It outperforms all the distro's meant to help 'old' systems run fast again.I've installed this on an old system I keep around to use more than anything else as our 'TV', but it's the *only* distro that doesn't take forever to start or run *any* app in the menu.My system:AMD Athlon II x2 250ASRock A770DE+ MOBONvidia GT520 video card4GB RAM250GB WD HD (old as dirt!)Creative Labs Sound Blaster Live! sound card (I got this  when it was a 'new' model!)The TDE/Trinity desktop also brings back wonderful memories of the days when KDE ran well and believed in the Linux/UNIX mantra of ""Do One Thing And Do It Well."". It also looks better than Plasma and gives me back some control of things that KDE, for whatever dumb reasons decided upon, took away from me/us/the linux community.Anyway, I got rid of Firefox simply because of everything on the stock menu in this installation it was the absolute slowest to start up. I replaced it with Brave Browser, which unfortunately isn't yet in any of the Devuan/Debian repositories.Everything else works wonderfully fast and are the old things I remember from the KDE 3 days. I do need to go to the forums though and ask how to install the Nvidia blob driver for this card, as the Wayland does seem to tear once in a while and I've always had beautiful luck with the blobs from Nvidia on my Slackware systems.I tried probably 6 other distro's on this system, in hopes of them working this fast and well, *before* finding ExeGNU, and they eventually disappointed severely one way or another (sound wouldn't work right or not at all, video worked so badly couldn't watch movies, everything started and ran like molasses in January, etc). I was skeptical of this distro too, but now that I've had it up and running for two weeks, this is the keeper for this system. I can't laud the dev's of this distro enough and that they used it as a dirivative of Devuan (also another wonderful distro, just not for *this* system, heh).Thank you, ExeGNU dev's for everything you've done and making it so I have good memories again and didn't have to throw a computer away that I've had for a decade plus!

My heart has always been with Arch and its derivatives, but my head has always been with Debian/Ubuntu and its derivatives for stability. However, Ubuntu and its old kernel doesn't work well on my Lenovo Idea Flex 5 with Irisxe graphics card.The screen had little white sparkles with ubuntu; with Garuda that does not happen.I think Garuda is the ""linux mint"" of Arch. I consider it better than ArcoLinux because it comes with more wizards for a linux newbie. I am not new to Linux, sometimes I set up distros from scratch, but when I have to work I like that the distro has everything.There are many who complain that it has a bright and tacky style. My goodness: today you can change the theme and icons in a minute in Linux, especially in Cinnamon or kde.I feel that the distro is modern, it is designed to be easy to use, and I don't care that it is ""bloated"": I need proprietary software to work, what can we do?Regarding Arch, it is the best derivative in my opinion, well above Manjaro or Arcolinux.I've had it installed on his desktop ""lxqt"" for months now and it has given me no problems. If you want stability, disable Caothic Aur and install flatpaks. It's not that difficult either.Good job, friends!!"
2240,2023-07-15, Garuda Linux, 230501,5,0,"An average Arch based distro, I don't see this offering anything noteworthy to the existing pool. At a pinch, maybe the bold colours out of the box, but nothing else. The installation worked fine, the DE worked, my laptop hardware was recognised and worked. Unfortunately, that is as as much as I can say, it didn't blow me away and it didn't cause me pain.  The colour palette is cool, the iconography is a little adolescent but functional, the installation is handled by Calamares, it defaults BTRFS, the assistant tool is much like the assistant apps you get with every other distro it is functional but offers nothing new, it includes Chaotic AUR by default (not sure this is the right choice).Yeah, I can't say what sets this distro apart from the rest, aside from the colours. "
2241,2023-07-14, Garuda Linux, 230501,10,2,"After an accidental stumbling on a second-hand budget-friendly HP 255 G7 Laptop on eBay, I decided to embark on a new Linux adventure. And what better companion than Garuda KDE Lite! Garuda KDE Lite is like a breath of fresh air for those seeking a rock-solid Linux distro without compromising on performance. With its minimalistic design, this feather-light Linux flavor effortlessly zips through my daily tasks, making it an ideal choice for common use.Installation was a breeze - smooth as silk. Within a few clicks, Garuda KDE Lite took over my system, leaving virtually no trace of the previous Windows occupant. It was a relief to witness an operating system that doesn't eat up valuable system resources but instead, optimizes them like a true Linux champ!The KDE desktop environment, with its sleek and modern appearance, adds a touch of elegance to my computing experience. Its intuitive nature ensures that even Linux newbies, like me, can swiftly adapt to its offerings. While not cluttered with unnecessary bloatware, Garuda KDE Lite equips users with all essential tools and applications - ensuring a productive workflow.I was truly impressed by the speed and responsiveness of this distro. Even with my modest AMD A4-9125 processor and 4GB RAM, Garuda KDE Lite never skips a beat. Multitasking became second nature, as applications seamlessly launch and switch, allowing me to effortlessly handle my daily tasks without any hiccups.The inclusion of a 128GB SSD with this budget laptop further enhances Garuda KDE Lite's performance prowess. The snappy boot times and rapid application loading are a testament to the power of this combination.While I'm not a hardcore gamer, I appreciate that Garuda KDE Lite focuses on delivering a smooth and reliable computing experience, tailored for common daily use. It may not be the go-to distro for gaming enthusiasts, but for everyone else seeking a hassle-free, dependable Linux environment, Garuda KDE Lite shines brightly.Garuda KDE Lite has definitely won me over with its winning combination of speed, stability, and user-friendly design. It proves that a budget laptop coupled with a well-optimized Linux distro doesn't have to compromise on quality.In conclusion, if you're seeking an affordable Linux distro that delivers an impressive performance out of the box without compromising your wallet, give Garuda KDE Lite a try. It's the perfect companion for those who want to take flight with Linux on a budget!5/5 stars to the Garuda Linux Team!!!"
2242,2023-07-07, Garuda Linux, 230501,10,0,"As someone with a notable history in breaking every Linux distro I’ve ever used, I can say Garuda has all the best measures put in place to keep my computer up and running no matter what I do to it. It has BTRFS with built in automatic snapshots configured automatically as soon as you install it, no setup required, and you can access and boot into snapshots from the bootloader without having to boot into your actual OS. Once you boot into the snapshot, a popup asks you if you want to restore this snapshot. If you select yes, it prompts you to reboot, and then that’s it, its seriously that easy. I use the dragonized gaming edition. The dragonized desktop definitely won’t be for everyone, you either like it or you don’t, I love it though. Lots of cool effects and a very attractive and sleek terminal. If it doesn’t seem like your kinda vibe, that’s fine because they have a massive selection of desktop environments to choose from otherwise. Garuda has a fantastic user experience with graphical tools to accomplish any task. From installing packages, to modifying boot options, to switching kernels, to managing drivers, it’s all so easy with the built in apps. The one-click system update even refreshes your mirror lists automatically.Needless to say, I like Garuda a lot. "
2243,2023-07-05, Garuda Linux, 230501,10,1,"Great Arch-based distro with very helpful tooling and sane defaults (BTRFS with snapshots, etc). Been using Garuda as my daily driver OS for almost 2 years now with only very minimal issues (which were easily resolved and/or rolled back). Very few other distros I've tried have had a comparable level of ""indestructibility"" (and I like to break things), package availability (although this is becoming less relevant thanks to the efforts of projects like DistroBox, etc), and overall system stability."
2244,2023-07-03, Garuda Linux, 230501,10,2,"Garuda is my new favourite distro. I actually use the Cinnamon variant, as I've never been a fan of Gnome or KDE, and I think many people dismiss Garuda as just a distro with a really fancy looking KDE theme. But under the hood, I find it is the best and easiest Arch based distro around.Specifically, I like that by default you have BTRFS with snapshots (easy recovery from broken updates), Zen Kernel, Pipewire, ZRAM for swap and access to both the standard and Chaotic AUR. So you essentially get an optimal workstation/gaming Arch install, that can be setup in minutes. Also comes with various useful configuration features to safe time/effort.I would still suggest a raw Linux beginner start with Mint. But for someone with a bit of Linux experience, who wants a really solid base Arch install, I think Garuda is the best there is."

I must say, I was thoroughly impressed with this Arch-based distro and how well it performed, even on my aging hardware. Garuda Linux Xfce has certainly stood out to me as one of the most user-friendly Arch distros I have come across during my distro-hopping journeys.One of the most significant highlights of Garuda Linux Xfce is the installation process. I found it to be a breeze, and one of the quickest and most straightforward installations I have performed. The installation guide is incredibly detailed, and the entire process took me less than 20 minutes to complete. Overall, the installation process was hassle-free, and I found it to be a great start to my experience with the system.Moving on to the desktop environment, I was delighted with the sleek and customizable Xfce desktop environment. Not only does it look great, but it is also highly customizable. Garuda Linux Xfce includes numerous pre-installed themes and plugins, making it easy for me to tailor my desktop according to my personal preferences. The system also uses the Garuda Welcome application, which provides new users with useful tips and information to help them get started with the system.In terms of performance, Garuda Linux Xfce did not disappoint either. Even when I was running multiple applications at the same time, I noticed no significant lag or slow performance. The system's speed and effectiveness exceeded my expectations, and I was pleased with how smoothly everything ran. Garuda Linux Xfce is an excellent option for those who are looking for a lightweight and dependable system that performs well, even on older hardware.Apart from its exceptional performance, the Garuda forum is quite possibly one of the friendliest Linux communities I have come across. The community is always willing to lend a helping hand and answer any questions I had along the way. Their knowledge and expertise were a fantastic resource that added even more value to my experience using Garuda Linux Xfce. Overall, the friendly and supportive community only adds to Garuda Linux Xfce's appeal as a top-notch Arch-based distro.In conclusion, I strongly recommend Garuda Linux Xfce to anyone searching for a user-friendly, lightweight, and high-performing Arch-based distro. Garuda Linux Xfce is an excellent choice for new Linux users as well, thanks to its intuitive installation and plethora of pre-installed themes and plugins. I believe Garuda Linux Xfce stands out in the ever-growing world of Linux distributions as a system that prioritizes simplicity and user convenience without sacrificing performance.Kudos to the Garuda Team & community!!!"

If you feel confident with a Ubuntu or Mint or MX Linux you could have a go at this.The welcome window is full of actually useful things,the Setup Assistant and Garuda Assistant will let you set things up and then look after them easily. The other tools are useful too and easy to guess what does what. Instead of processes running in GUIs you click and then watch it all happen in a terminal. Fun and a bit educational.Dolphin file manager comes set up so it's simple to use root without the terminal, directly editing root files for example, simpler than on any other distro I know, so though it is a terminal centred distro you don't have to use terminal commands to get lots done.I've found it solid and stable, more so than other Arch distros I've tried recently which seem suddenly to be a bit flaky on my hardware.Lots of documentation and comprehensive forums, I admit turning number lock off permanently was beyond me, I've a funny laptop about number lock, but a quick search found the solution.And I think it's a good looking distro."

I'm pretty new to Arch-based distros and I was hopping around trying a few out. While I've been using Linux for a few years, I'm no super user by any means. I do some gaming, mainly on Steam, and it has worked beautifully with one exception: after a reboot it doesn't recognize my Xbox 360 wired controller. I type in sudo modprobe xpad into the terminal and that usually fixed it. It's been about the only necessary time where I've actually needed to use the terminal, not just because I wanted to. If my Steam games still don't pick it up, then I just unplug it and plug it back in and it's fixed. There has been one or two times updating has resulted in a partial upgrade. I just wait about two days, and try it again. The Garuda team usually has whatever happened fixed by then, at least I assume it's them. Outside of those two issues, everything from Nvidia drivers to my spaz-tastic printer has worked right out of the box. It's been my daily driver for about 2-3 months now and it's been fantastic.

2264,2023-02-20, Garuda Linux, 221019,9,0,"Garuda Linux is very customizable, even though it has the KDE Plasma desktop enviroment. I like it first of all because it's easy to use, from the installation to whatever you wanna do. I also appreciate that it has the ""Garuda Welcome"" app, because i'm a Linux Gamer and i can easily access the stuff i need. One of my favourite things it's that you don't have to do all of those messy things to install Wine. I swear that before this i had Ubuntu, and like 1 year after i discovered how to install Wine. In this distro, you just open Garuda Welcome, select Garuda Gamer, check Wine and see the PC do all the rest. Even if it's based on Arch, it's not hard to understand. The fish shell is very nice and user-friendly even for users who come from Windows or MacOS (Macintosh, OS X). I think it's a great way to introduce people to linux but even a good way fol Gurus to keep this. I like it and according to me it's the best linux distro, but it's my opinion only. I  would suggest this to anyone. "
2265,2023-02-17, Garuda Linux, 201205,10,0,"Maybe 3 months isnt a realistic time frame to evaluate stability on a bleeding edge distro, but anyway, my mind blows on how stable Garuda is given that I had great prejudices against Arch-based distros. I thought Arch would be difficult and one had to tinker alot in the terminal to do anything. And all I have heard about bleeding edge rolling releases, that it was more usual than not that something got borked with updates. I have had nada, everything just works. And I look for updates almost every day. It is MX-linux class stability imo.I do have a fairly powerful computer with new components (z790 i7 13700 32GB  RAM) I guess since Garuda is bleeding edge I have not had any of the minor cosmetic issues I have had with MX-linux and others, with KDE Plasma especially.It came as a pleasant surprice for me that suddenly I was able to install Windows 11 and dualboot without problems, Garuda boot menu finds W11 at boot after I installed Windows 11.( I do have both OS´s on separate SSD´s  though)Performance is awesome, everything is fast as lightning. For example I see no difference between chrome based browsers and Firefox. In other distros and windows Firefox has always been maybe a second slower on startup and slightly, slightly slower in rendering web pages.And thats is with 27 extensions. But I notice there is a price to pay for the fastness. I do get slightly higher temp on GPU when doing ordinary stuff like browsing and watching videos compared to Windowsand Mx-linux. In windows I have a temperature of 31-33 celcius on CPU and 34 on GPU, in garuda the temperature hovers around 43-45 on GPU and ~40 on CPU. But that is of course not a big issue.I have tested alot of installs to test different apps, if I dont want them I just use the backup tool on BTRFS (Snapper) to reboot and the new install never existed. I have yet to have any problems with that. It gives me flashbacks to the awesome tool I used in Windows many years ago: Firstdefense ISR. I know it is a completely another way technically, but the feeling of security when you can boot back as if nothing ever happened.Anyways. Garuda is definately my daily driver now."
2266,2023-02-08, Garuda Linux, 221019,10,0,"Used Manjaro Gnome since December 2021 and got problems the last months (Firefox crashes often @ Browser-Gaming with Intel UHD750, missing Hardware-Acceleration H.264/H.265 with AMD graphics card), so looking for another Arch based distro.Pure Arch isn`t mine as I´m no terminal expert, so decided to give Garuda Gnome a chance. Looks really nice ootb (only installed ""Dock from Dash""), easy to install, btrfs + snapper configurated by default ... and until now no issues. Happy with my new daily driver!"

Garuda inherits the best of Arch Linux, with a customized, performance-oriented backend. The Welcome Assistant and customization (such as choosing the graphical package manager) is what puts this ahead of other distros.While not for everyone, those who are accustomed to using Linux for their daily desktop driver will find Garuda to provide the best of both worlds, while respecting the user with a spirited community that puts the users ahead of any corporate mission.Manjaro and EndeavorOS users will be pleased with the power that Garuda offers."

Super solid.Garuda will work only on those HDD / SSD which dont have a secondary OS installed.And frankly speaking I am used to it now.... no more windows.upgrades are rapid due to rolling releases and system is super stable.loved pacman now and also fine with okular.flatpak is also supported so you wont find being left out.I am used to the dark themes and my daily office work with zoom calls and Citrix remoting works like a charm.Infact I struggled with such stability in Debain and Manjaro.Kernel upgrades are almost immediate and the forum is good and not rude.if you have a HDD to spare Garuda is the distro for you !!"
2269,2023-01-17, Garuda Linux, 221019,9,0,Coming from Windows 10 on my Computer I wanted a Linux Distribution that looks good enough and works well for gaming.The website impressed me and I thought I'd just give it a try. And now I am using Windows only for doing my tax and am really happy with how it's going.I really like the built-in snapper tool and that it comes preinstalled with BTRFS. The update command makes updating really easy and the Snapshot integration into GRUB makes reverting mistakes easy.Compared to Ubuntu with GNOME on my Laptop I really enjoyed the customizability of KDE and the default Dr460nized icons and layout.I dislike that there are some problems that I just cannot solve. But in my experience there was always at least one unsolvable problem when I used Linux so it's not really a downside specific to Garuda. 
2270,2023-01-15, Garuda Linux, 221019,9,3,"     I have used many different linux distributions over the years. I started years ago because I had a windows xp computer and thought that it was ridiculous that a computer should become e-waste because an os stops receiving support/updates. I still consider myself very much a novice with linux even though it has been my primary os for years. I work long hours driving a tractor trailer so in my off time when I need to sit down and pay bills, go through email, etc. I need the computer to ""just work"" and not be a project to make it work, which is why I have used MX linux for the past few years. I have always had an interest in rolling releases such as Arch, however when attempting to install Arch I felt that I was in over my head. That is why I have been using point releases.      Every so often I check out DistroWatch to see what's new in the Linux world and Garuda caught my eye. In particular the ability to roll back using snapper if experiencing a problem was of interest. I was formerly dual booting with Windows 10 but the only thing I needed it for was to update my Garmin GPS. Garuda does not support dual booting but I took a chance and about two weeks ago I installed Garuda and gave it the whole hard drive. If I have to I can reinstall Windows 10 though I doubt that I will.      The first impression of Garuda is impressive. The visual appeal is very pleasing, it is very colorful. If you want it to be a little less colorful you can customize to suit your needs. I have been using it as my primary os for the past two weeks and I like it. I am not highly skilled with the terminal and I have been able to update, and install software as needed with ""Garuda Assistant"". I will continue to use Garuda unless I encounter a problem that leaves me unable to use my computer. I will have a copy of MX Linux on a USB just in case it is needed. The developers of Garuda have put a lot of work into this distro and it shows. Thanks for all of your hard work"

So my distro hopping starts to wake up again.I decided I will give some Arch based distro a go. Installation of Garuda was much easier than I anticipated after reading about how difficult Arch can be. I was also surprised over how easy it is to install software. Basically no need to use the terminal, unless you prefer it. I have only been using it roughly a month and are still waiting for it to go bonkers after some update. But it does use BTRFS and it has these snapshots it takes every time Garuda does an update, or when installing something. That is very neat. I have done a couple of restores just for the heck of it and it works flawlessly.I got rid of the always boring dark theme that is so common in Linux these days, and configured Plasma to my liking instead. In MX-Linux I never managed to get it to use 120Mhz on my Acer Predator monitor, it was stuck att 100Mhz. In Garuda I have full Mhz finally. And Garuda/arch feels much snappier than other distros (debian based) I have tried. I also had som occational problems in MX where the monitor wouldnt wake up from sleep. Not once had that problem in Garuda.I am gonna use Garuda from now on. I expect some troubles in the future since it is bleeding edge, but I have yet to experience any problems.Great distro for people like me who has been hesitant to use Arch based distros out of fear that it would be too complicated."

2280,2022-11-05, Garuda Linux, 221019,9,54,"Coming from Windows with some minor Linux and Solaris Unix experience from 30 years ago, I finally found my daily Linux distribution for my 7 years old PC: Garuda LXQT KWin! In dual boot with Windows 10! Garuda is fun, modern, productive, quick, snappy and it did not cause bigger problems for me as a relative beginner.I like to do hobby coding with C++ (VS Code) and some productive stuff with Linux. Before finding Garuda, I tried out many other  distros (live systems), roughly 50 distros in sum. Most of them did not convince me, esp. due to the ugliness of the DE, esp. the icons or lack of visual effects. Based on my experience with those 50 distros, my favourites ones were: Manjaro KDE and MX Linux KDE. By chance a DevOp friend mentioned Garuda Linux being used by him and his team at work for development and I got intrigued to try the different DE versions of Garuda out. Before that, I never had Garuda on my radar.In the end, I had to select between Garuda LXQT and  Garuda KDE Dr460nized incl. Gaming Edition. Garuda KDE looked promising, but it was problematic due to recurring problems with the Latte dock and the weird central menu which I did not like at all (it was not productive for me).My plan was to install Garuda LXQT as dual boot with Windows 10 without installing a bootloader in the MBR or GPT.  For this purpose I created  a boot partition formatted as BTRFS (not as  FAT32!)  During the boot in the BIOS I have the option to manually select the disk with my Garuda boot partition, and voilà Garuda is starting without the need to interfere with Windows, MBR or GPT. You should not format the boot partition with FAT32 as according to my own experience Windows seemingly removes the Grub on a FAT32 partition once in a while so that you cannot boot Linux anymore!Cool stuff:-Arch linux: always the newest version of software at your fingertips (compared to Debian)-BTRFS, allowing to install snapshots if problems occur, no need for a swap partition, it is handled via the File System-very good assistant helping to perform the installation and maintenance tasks-modern look and feel, not dull and old-fashioned -different software package repositories with tools, ample binaries, chaotic AUR-really quick and snappy UX, ZRAM activated, used roughly < 2 GByte from my 32 GB RAM which is nothing for me-Cairo dock is not causing problems (compared to Latte)-everything needed works as I want-needed software is available: VS Code (Open Source version and MS version), newest gcc compiler, browsers etc.Problems:-the Garuda browser FireDragon is not configured optimally: I had to deactivate the hardware accelaration flag (set by Garuda) which caused weird coloring and artefacts in YT-some dark themes are not readable (grey fonts under grey background), but you can adjust it-it was tricky to find out how to change the horizontal panel to vertical (not described, but easy to be done once you know how)On my other laptop I have also a dual boot system: MX Linux KDE with Windows 10. Here I installed the bootloader to the GPT, also working without problems.In sum: I liked to have a dual boot option in case Linux does not support my hardware (souncards and WLAN caused problems), so that I can switch quickly to the other OS. Meanwhile I spend more time with Linux than with Windows, it is quick, it is  free, it does not send telemetric and personal data to unknown centres, it is fun.Kudos from Germany to the folks from India, Canada and the rest of the world which made Garuda available! May the eagle fly!"

Garuda gives me two KDE versions, a very customized, opinionated Mac-like version of KDE Plasma or a Bare-bones KDE edition (plus many more DE/WMs). Garuda uses the BTRFS file system and has applications to maintain that system as well. BTRFS provides copy-on-write snapshots as a means of quickly restoring the system in case of system faults. Garuda gives the user an easy installation with the Calamares offline installer. The developers have provided first-run applications to help setup and others to help maintain both editions. It uses the Pacman and Octopi package managers.  I can easily configure it as a RAM-using speed demon desktop for my tower PC or take a more conservative approach on my laptop. Garuda provides simple to use  scripts for each.      I have been using desktop Linux as my mainstay for 20+ years. I have been using Arch and Arch-based distributions for 10+ years.

I tried everything lately (Fedora, Debian, Neon, Kubuntu, oSuse) but Siduction was the only distro that gave me ""No bootable medium found"" after installation. That was with EFI boot - installing with BIOS boot it worked fine. I ended up installing Debian and next installing Siduction into the Debian partition. That worked for EFI.I made a full disk backup wit Clonezilla and later restored it ... to end up with a system that would not boot. That has never happened with any of the other distros I tried. So I chrooted into the partition and reinstalled grub. Now I am back in business. The screen flickered frequently (KDE/Plasma). I tried kernel parameters in /etc/default/grub that had no effect. In fact, that config file is never used because siduction's config in /etc/default/grub.d/ overrides it. But siduction also uses a bleeding edge kernel that is even newer than the one in Debian unstable. I removed it and now use the Debian unstable kernel without flickering.Almost all of the packages come straight from Debian unstable, i.e. Debian's repo is used directly. Siduction adds some artwork, scripts and configs but very little else.Out of almost 1500 packages on my system only 1 comes from Siduction to replace a package from Debian. And, strangely, apt-listbugs is not installed (you really need that on Debian unstable). And I am sorry to say I do not like the artwork.Obviously Sidiction is not for the faint-hearted, but I did end up with a rolling-release system that is probably more stable than Arch or Tumbleweed. For the time being.I use Debian unstable on another computer and I know that sooner or later that system will fail. I happened before. It will happen again. But I hope that somehow Siduction will keep running on that unfortunate day. When that happens I will be back here with praises and a much higher rating.Have a nice day!JS"

However, during my first run, I discovered that there was no sound. I spent the next two days adjusting the settings, working the command line, and looking for help on the internet. All to no avail.

There are only two distros in the Debian class that I've used in either a commercial setting or at home for years at a time: Debian Stable and Mint Xfce.Mint was the last distribution that I had on both my laptop and desktop for the past 5 or six years without a problem. Unfortunately, my laptop recently crashed (from all the abuse it took over those years). Which left me with my desktop. I had upgraded from Mint 18 to 19 to 20 without any problems. I had ZFS in a RAIDZ configuration on four 4TB drives and a 500GB nvme drive as my main boot device. It wasn't until my attempt to update to Mint 21.1, and all hell broke loose. Since then, I've been fighting with several distros, trying to get my system back to the way I like it. I've tried MX Linux, Debian STABLE and TESTING, Ubuntu, Xubuntu (since I prefer Xfce), and even went back to FreeBSD for a go. However, none really came close to fitting the bill, except surprisingly enough, Ubuntu did. But there are still a few quirks about Ubuntu that I can do without... Snaps, I'm talking to you!!!.So, the other day, I stumbled upon ""siduction"", and all I can say is WOW!!! I installed the Xfce version on both my laptop and desktop, and was up and running on both within a matter of minutes. With all the tweaks I had to do on both systems, I would say it too me about 5 hours each, to get them configured to where I was comfortable them.""siduction"" is a fantastic distro. The community has done an outstanding job with it. They've managed to do all the ""heavy-lifting"" for you. Unfortunately, there is one snag I've run into, which is why I can only give it a 9/10 rating, and that has to do with not being able to get ZFS working on it, yet. Tomorrow is another day, and I'll continue to keep diving into trying to solve this problem. If anything, I'm going to keep ""siduction"" on my laptop, and if worse-comes-to-worse, then I'll put Ubuntu back on my desktop, because I'm not about to let 16TB of disk space go to waste."
2293,2023-03-12, siduction, 22.1.1,10,4,"I've been using Ubuntu, Mint, for almost 20 years now.  I rarely ever install Debian because of the massive effort required to tune the system for my needs.  I finally decided to test Siduction after years of avoiding it because of it's ""unstable"" nature.  well after 8 weeks of testing I can say that the distro installs nicely, it comes configured with the right set and amount of apps, the filesystem is properly configured, everything works on my computers running it, the packages are amazingly fresh, and it is stable.  Also the MOW desktop look is rather nice.  This is my go-to distro from now on, I am done with distrohopping."
2294,2023-02-23, siduction, 22.1,9,5,"Obviously very updated distribution, perhaps more than Arch and for the moment I would say stable.The LXQT version is fast and responsive and with neat and pleasant graphics.The only annoying thing is that to update safely you have to exit in ""int 3"" but since this protects the system that's fine.I haven't encountered any driver problems and I've only once had to wait a day to be able to install software that had an unresolved dependency.The documentation is very well done.I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the distribution."
2295,2023-02-22, siduction, 22.1,4,0,"Was using 21.3.0 Wintersky in a virtual machine and was about to install on the hardware as my daily use machine.   It takes me awhile to move to another install as there are gigabytes of mail and other items, along with reshuffling partitions.The VM quit working after one of the updates, well exactly the keyboard worked EXEPT for the enter key, couldn't even signon to the GUI. Could get into it in text mode but never got it functional with the GUI. May have been a missmatch with VIrtualBox extras.I finally decided to install the new release 22.1 Masters of war. Wrong move.  The Task bar has become a nightmare. It doesn't perform anything like the prior release. They have decided to use a floating bar with the running tasks, sorry that's not my idea of useful I don't want to chase the floating taskbar when I want to switch to another running task. There doesn't appear any way to move the running tasks back to what was the normal task bar in 21.3.0. All the icons about the system are located on the left, with no apparent way to move them back to the right. I know the developers have just got to play with the new shinny objects BUT please give us a SINGLE place to set things on the desktop back to what they were. General comment Siduction appears to purge all the graphics from prior releases immediately on moving to the next release, would be nice to have the desktop images for prior releases, I happened to like the Wintersky background.Back to testing Mint Cinnamon and openSuSE Leap. Still trying Manjaro BUT as many of the current distros it has problems connecting AND staying connected to my Epson XP-7100 or Cannon MG7720."

2300,2022-06-25, siduction, 21.3.0,10,2,Great experience so far. Very stable and great forum for support. And I love KDE since I used it first on OpenSUSE Tumbleweed. Compared to Tumbleweed (rolling release as well) the updates are lower in download size but not so much in update time. However no issue at all. Very pleased with Siduction.It is probably true that the developer base is not so huge. One more reason to support this distro. Really great work done. Let's hope it will be around for a long time.Wish the team all the best for the future!!!
2301,2022-06-01, siduction, 21.3.0,9,5,"There are some rough edges on this distribution. Somehow that is something one would expect from a distribution based on Debian's so called ""unstable"" branch. Still, Siduction is running perfectly fine for years now on all my machines being laptops or classic desktop PCs.What needs to be improved are the preinstalled applications and tools. There is way too much clutter and duplicates of tools for the same purpose. Nothing severe of course and an ""apt purge"" away from the user having a lean and clean system. But still, that's what I would expect from a distribution: a sane and well chosen application set.Still, all in all Siduction has a lot of points on the plus side:- solid base- devs respond quickly- friendly, helpful community both on forums and IRC- interesting choice for rolling release users"
2302,2022-04-03, siduction, 18.3.0,10,5,"Absolute best debian install I have ever used.  If you need networking and administration in a working environment, this is it.I have no cons for this distribution as yet.  Been using it in a work and personal environment for several months.  I use it with things taken from MX.  Mostly applications such as Featherpad, Notepadqq, Remmina etc.  I use it with KDE which has improved greatly over the years mainly for dolphin and effective mixed networking environment.  For me it is the magic combination of things that work.  Years ago I used this combination effectively but KDE became unusable so I switched to Meppis then debian as Mepis faltered then MX and now full circle back to debian unstable rolling via siduction.  I really don't want to fix my distro all the time and siduction just works.  Hope it stays that way."

2309,2021-11-05, siduction, 21.2.0,9,1,"I'm using the KDE version, which is apparently the flagship for this interesting distro.  Nearly everything comes from Debian unstable (sid) which should make siduction unstable too, but it does not.  I've had less breakage with this than with released versions of Ubuntu and openSUSE tumbleweed though these are far more tested and curated.  The ""Handbuch"" is very good documentation, clear and understandable to me even though I had my last formal instruction in German well over a half century ago and have rarely used it since.  They say they're working on an English translation....They recommend updating in runlevel 3, which I'm used to doing in Tumbleweed.  This can be kind of a pain but it seems to be worth it to avoid problems.  I wrote a little shell script that uses tmux to show htop, sensors and nmon as well as the apt output which makes it interesting.I wouldn't be using this if I were designing life-support equipment or bridges, but for my simple use case it is safe enough and it is fun to be on the bleeding edge.I put my money where my mouth was and sent them a small donation today.  This is a tiny project and deserves to grow."
2310,2021-11-04, siduction, 21.2.0,9,0,"I came to using this on the daily after remembering that it was a thing a year or so back. A that time a new ISO hand't released since roughly 2018 and I was not comfortable installing from media that old (prior experiences with Arch and Manjaro led to this decision), so I dabbled with the likes of Mageia (another highly recommended distro btw) and even OpenBSD. When I heard news of this new release, I had to try it, so I installed (install was quick, in under 15 minutes) and haven't looked back since. After installation, the only thing left to do was to install my preferred suite of software (coming from Arch, I was surprised that most of my AUR programs were either available as binaries in the main repos, or from source.) and disabling the unattended-upgrades so I could more freely use the package manager. I don't need to talk about how good apt-get is, as I'm sure many of you already know. Printer support is just fine, and WINE works fine enough if you were to need a windows program for whatever reason. This distro is great for those users which are seasoned as well as those who are just starting out their Linux journey.I cannot recommend this distro highly enough."

From a user's perspective there is almost no visible change but regarding administration it should be noted, that Siduction is based on... guess what?

By the way: It was impossible to install a working WINE, and you have to look in the internet how to activate sudo because it doesn't work neither.

This distro may not be as flashy as some of the other ""Pen Test"" distros but it is a useful and easy to learn OS. the base install includes many of the standard tools of the trade. However, you can install and use other tools, of the trade, by doing what Linux is made for. Customization is easy and I personally have never had an issue with installing the base system in any way. Patches and updates are easy to manage and again being a DEB/Ubuntu means no mysteries or gotchas await the committed Linux user.I am also to understand that another high profile ""Pen Test"" distro is a branch of BackBox."

I love pfSense! I've been using it for over a year now and I must say that it truly is worth it, even to have it for pfblockerng alone! It's really easy to throw it on a thinclient (I use it on an HP T520 thinclient) so that way it's completely silent as there are no fans. The HP T620PLUS is pretty popular for pfSense because of the expansion port but you almost don't need that if you're a bit frugal. On my T520 I just cut a small piece out of the case and installed an mPCIe Intel network adapter and the actual port comes out of the hole that I cut. It works and it was cheap! I see a lot of reports saying to use Intel based hardware but the Realtek network adapters work just fine as well. But this little mod will ensure you can use pfSense on more thinclients than just the PLUS models.If you own a Roku, it's also a must have device! Combined with pfBlockerNG, you'd be shocked at just how much garbage the Roku tries to access to serve up ads and other junk. Probably phoning home too for all you know. It will not eliminate YouTube ads unfortunately but it's still really good for what it does and can help stop many regular ads before they go out to your network so it's still a win win and your browser based adblocker won't have to work quite as hard. So if you're serious about your network and want to up its game, get pfSense today!"
2327,2022-06-22, pfSense, 2.6.0,8,1,"The OG of BSD firewall distros. One of the first ones I've used and probably the most well known. I recommended the pfSense hardware a lot because I think they have the best turn key hardware solution. I'm not a fan of how they have split up the solution into a Community Edition and paid for Plus edition, but I understand they need to make money. Not a fan of the strange politics with their fork, it's natural for projects to fork so different solutions can be tried. It's good for the open source community so I don't understand why there needs to be any bad blood.For awhile the updates came very slow which was a big turn off for me. I like to be patched quickly but they do have good QA testing IMO so I found fewer things broke after an upgrade. I wish there was more openness to running this software on non-vendor hardware and keeping the original BSD license but that does not affect the technical ability or features of this software. I feel the UI needs a refresh or reorg as it's getting cluttered and seems to be held back by a lot of legacy features and how things were done in the past."

2340,2022-08-05, Obarun, 2022.06.08,7,11,"If it installs, Obarun is a great little distro. More arch-y than Arch, the most advanced supervision and init system around, a real winner. But only IF you get it installed, because the install process is a bit of a lottery. On some machines I installed it smoothly, without any issue. Other machines gave me the full Odyssey experience, just trying to get home but being faced with one legendary issue after another. Obarun tries to stay as close as it can to a distro that famously adopted systemd into every vein, whilst not applying systemd. This causes a lot of disconnects, which the team struggles to keep up with. Sometimes they are pretty up to date, sometimes they are way behind and issues pop up everywhere."

Even though it is still a bit rough around the edges, it's a transparent, elegantly simple and rock solid experience. Anyone with a little linux experience can navigate through the installation process well enough to set up any system required. All the advantages of Arch, none of the systemd black voodoo.

I have been using DynFi Firewall since v.1.00 as a SMB device filtering a network with 10+ devices. I have learnt to use the DNS filtering which is both easy and rapid to deploy (provided that you have a powerful enough device). This is most welcome to improve FW security, without the burden of more resource intensive solutions which are offered on similar Open Source FWs.I have also setup a VPN with OpenVPN for my remote work requirements and firewall filtering. I would definitely recommend the use of this open source firewall which brings useful additional features, beyond the expected behavior of OPNsense and pfSense.This a most welcome addition to BSD based firewalls, and will certainly foster some improvements across the board for what has become an affordable open source alternative to expensive commercial firewalls.

Tremendous tool. The newer optional compression format is great, which is faster and has higher compression.And yes, CZ can restore to smaller partitions, in Expert Mode.The downside is that the interface is ugly and confusing. Especially, there is a logical inconsistency on the Select Repository screen, where the partition's root is actually pre-selected, but the the first item is highlighted as if it is, and remains so even when exiting the screen.Also, persistence would be a huge plus, so that keyboard mapping wouldn't have to be done each boot."

Elementary has never been a good choice for a desktop OS. It's pretty but functionally useless.The most horrible file manager imaginable. One of the most important pieces of software on a PC and Elementary completely screws it up. App center is hit or miss if it will work. Very poor performance. Unstable. A nightmare to customize. problematic networking issues and doesn't work well at all with VPN's. Just no longer worth the download. It is a complete waste of time. The developers have absolutely 0 interest in making it better or listening to users feedback.Very restrictive, very quirky. Weird bugs here and there. Not a huge fan of the App Center at all, which isn't a deal breaker for me since I've been using Linux long enough to know what I use and have all of the installs scripted from the command line, but it's still nice to go in and poke around to find new things every once in a while. There are enough issues with this distro to the point where it's not worth messing with anymore just to get it working as well as something like Mint does out of the box, so it's not for me."

Updates stalled...took a long time.  What is offered free is not what I wanted.  It looks pretty but that isn't the most important part of a linux os.  I see others had similar views of Elementary.  It is going downhill unnecessarily.  Perhaps later, I will give it another shot, but not today.  I deleted it off the drive I had installed it on with sadness."
2365,2023-07-21, elementary OS, 7.0,2,5,"Probably the painful experience I've had with a Linux distro. As an out-of-the-box distro it was practically unusable.It looks great and Pantheon is well-made and easy to learn, and the emphasis on keyboard shortcuts is great since I was looking for a distro to install on my laptop, but I gave up trying to use it.Live USB takes unusually long time to load, and very frequently hangs before it could even load into the desktop environment. Even when I get to the desktop environment the installer and greeter would randomly freeze and buttons randomly stop being responsive.I had trouble getting custom install to work as the installer just stops working, and I only found out that there was a mistake partitioning the drive and I only found that out because I tried installing Debian instead and received an error there.After I managed to find out the correct partition size and install the OS, I log into the live environment, only to find out that none of the softwares launch properly and the login menu stuck on the screen.

This system is an anti-advertisement for the open source movement. This system is a paywall. It doesn't even deserve 1/10. Less than zero is, in my opinion, the only correct rating for this distro."
2367,2023-06-09, elementary OS, 7.0,4,7,"Elementary OS is essentially a walled-garden operating system like Apple without any useful apps included. Beginners will find this distro frustrating to use since the AppCenter only contains a small number of curated apps; this distro by default doesn’t even include an office-suite or an alternative web-browser that isn’t gnome web (which is one of the worst web browsers I’ve ever used). Users are required to manually sideload Flatpaks into the AppCenter in order to have access to any useful applications at all. Manually side-loading Flatpaks is a poor design choice and it only adds more hoops that a new user needs to jump through.Elementary OS does have a few positives. It is the most visually appealing Linux distro that I’ve ever used. I also found the Pantheon desktop environment to be very intuitive with the easy-to-learn keyboard shortcuts and the multi-touch gestures for window management. If I didn’t mind spending the extra time configuring additional software and repositories, then I wouldn’t mind using this distro as my daily driver.However, as others pointed out, NVIDIA drivers do not cooperate well with Elementary. Installing the NVIDIA 515 driver completely borked my desktop environment, resulting in my computer booting into a command line. This is an issue that I haven’t experienced with other Ubuntu-based distros on my System76 laptop.In summary, I’d avoid Elementary OS if you’re a Linux beginner or a user with an NVIDIA graphics card. I’d only recommend Elementary OS if you love the Mac OS aesthetic of the desktop and you don’t mind spending the extra time configuring additional software/repositories on a fresh install.Recommended alternatives: 1. Ubuntu Mate with the Pantheon desktop layout2. Ubuntu Budgie"

I honestly don't understand what others are complaining about. Granted, I don't do discrete graphics and I'm not a gamer. I use the computer for work, research and also to play movies and TV shows. That's it. I haven't found any quirks that stand out above and beyond other distros. Just different quirks, is all. It is speedy and responsive, the design is excellent, and the roadmap is worthy of long term commitment. I love its seamless integration of Flatpak (not sure what others are complaining about there). No issues with hardware compatibility bc I a. use linux-compatible hardware and support hardware mfrs who support open source driver development and b. look before I leap.I get the sense that people who complain about eOS are used to using their computers as toys that they play with and tweak incessantly, or expect everything to work just because it does on a parent distro. admittedly, elementary OS doesn't do well with 3rd party tweaks. It's a fairly ""rigid"" system in that respect. Which is fine for me, because I hate doing that anyway. I install the OS, install my apps, configure a few settings, and go on my merry way. Also, the OS is in a strange divergent space where it has evolved pretty far beyond being merely an Ubuntu derivative, just as (though not quite as much as) Ubuntu has evolved beyond merely being a Debian derivative. There's going to be a little awkwardness there, but it hasn't been anything I couldn't work with as of yet.I may change my mind when I start to use the computer for music production work. We shall see, there. But I'm about to upgrade to 7.0. We'll see what that offers. I never upgrade immediately, but wait several months for others to work out the kinks for me. Those who upgrade immediately and complain about bugs...well, that's on you, bud. You volunteered for the public beta (which is what every first round public release is, everywhere...it is completely unrealistic to expect that devs work out all the bugs without releasing a version or two into the wild).The main area where I believe elementary OS falls flat is that community support is lacking for how to do anything that is elementary OS specific (vs something that I can accomplish by searching for Ubuntu). These are niche cases and fairly rare, but they do exist."
2373,2023-04-20, elementary OS, 7.0,3,4," After spending about three weeks with elementary o.s. 7, I am afraid it's another release with a show stopping bug. I am not going to beat the proverbial dead horse here. I made the decision to embrace the e o.s. way of doing things so I'm not going to list the usual stuff most complain about. Instead, I will list a few things I have noticed that make this release and the project questionable.First and most important is... Nvidia is completely busted on this distro. It will not install at all through the app center. It says it does but when you reboot you will find it hasn't. If you try alternate methods like via the terminal or synaptic. you will end up with a borked system. Why? This time it's not Nvidia's fault when every other Debian and Ubuntu based distro it installs and works fine. This is specific to elementary o.s. which brings me to the second. Bug reporting. Say I wanted to file a bug about this. I found that the bug reporting is their GitHub. I was asked to make a GitHub account. Just to file a bug? I'm not a dev. I'm a user that really just want's to file a bug and hope it gets fixed. That brings me to the third point. Where is the forum and community? I found their Reddit page. Which is fine but does the developer of the distro still check there. I used to see the name pop up in threads answering some of the users questions. That was quite a long time ago. Also, the reddit is nearly like a ghost town. As polarizing as e o.s. is, you would think there would be much more activity. I could only find one other forum where many questions go unanswered. Maybe it's just me and I have been in Debian too long where things are logical. The community forums are where problems are solved. If the forums are slow or dead where does one go get answers? There is also not much if any documentation either. One final thing and this plagues many distros is reliance on Flatpaks. I like flatpaks just fine. However, I noticed that on e o.s. that about every two days I would get prompted to install anywhere from 1 to 2 GB of flatpak updates. At that rate it's not going to be long before your hard drive fills up. Maybe e o.s. should reconsider shipping a store with debs and flatpaks, letting the user choose like Linux Mint does. Just a thought, and with that the journey ends.I gave three stars because I find Pantheon a nice D.E. It might be more advantageous for the elementary project to do something similar to what Budgie is now and just make a good Desktop Environment for other distros to ship. That way we can have the best of both worlds and maybe less bugs. That's just my opinion though. Thanks for reading."
2374,2023-04-13, elementary OS, 7.0,1,7,"I'm very curious as to how many people actually use this as a daily driver. Meaning this is exclusively the distribution they use for production, gaming and/or just general use. Cause for the life of me I have a hard time imagining this is a thing.elementary OS seems to be more of something people dabble in out of shear curiosity or are just looking for a challenge.The out of the box experience, for me, was a myriad of emotion. Confusion and frustration washed over me pretty quickly. Sadness and denial popped in at one point as well.How can something with so many issues be considered as a stable release? Luckily I don't have an nVidia GPU. So I can't blame it on that. Bundled apps are very inconsistent with stability. App Center by far was the worst. Dark mode was not respected system wide.This is not something I would use for anything. Nor would I trust it lasting for the foreseeable future. It just doesn't have the force or backing to drive it successfully. While I do admire its attempt to be different, I don't with its execution."

I can say without a shadow of a doubt this one was my worst experience. With the Nvidia drivers that it gave by default my screen had a green tint, this is probably not entirely their fault as I have seen this behavior in Ubuntu before. But once you install the correct Nvidia drivers to correct this issue NETWORKING stops working.It did this twice, the first time I thought I may have done something stupid and reinstalled the OS to try again and it did it again.I know there are things to like about this distro but I feel they need to put some more work out especially for Nvidia drivers.

Got it installed and it couldn't even get my local time correct.After a few minutes of simply looking around, it stuttered then froze. Had to hard reboot.Tried to surf the Internet with the stock browser. It was sooooo slow. Page would start to load, then stop, load a little more then stop. Reminded me of the old dial-up days. Turned out to be an issue with the wireless. I attempted to resolve the issue but I could only get connected solid by plugging into Ethernet.OK so... seems to be in the reviews very bad experiences with the App Center. This too was my experience. Using the App Center GUI was really bad. It would stall, freeze and just seem to freak out. Running updates through the CLI was better but still very slow.If you absolutely have to use Pantheon DE, there ARE other distributions that offer it up as an option. I suspect you'll have a much better experience using an alternative. I have to be honest, I really didn't like this. The default setup is very odd. Pantheon tweaks helps but not enough for me to keep using this. The bundled apps too are very odd. Super generic and flaky. Just not good. You also have to manually kick of Flathub software. It does not come per-configured.Nope sorry not a fan. "
2377,2023-03-08, elementary OS, 7.0,3,21,"I'm probing elementaryOS 7 since a couple of weeks. I came across due to the release announcement on distrowatch.com.For downloading the ISO, the developer team asks for a donation. While it seems at the beginning, it cannot be downloaded without a donation, putting 0 (zero) amount allows to download it for free.I was willing to give a donation to support the development, but wanted to try it before. Which turned out as a wise decision.Pro's:- Very beautiful and intiutive Pantheon desktop environment.- Smooth installation process.- Lean initial setup with small number of pre-installed applications.Con's:- Many pre-installed applications are buggy:  - AppCenter crashes when trying to click a specific category, e.g. ""Office"".  - Video player plays video sound, but doesn't show the picture.  - Mail doesn't work at all. Crashes with every second click. I needed to replace this with Geary.- Some strange default settings, e.g. mouse middle click (to paste in the terminal) is disabled.- While the desktop environment is nice as mentioned above, the window manager misses some controls, e.g. to minimize a window. Right-click on the window title and select 'Hide' or press Cmd+H keys will do the job. That's cumbersome. And there is no option to configure this.- Most of the system updates running via AppCenter require a restart. Why? It's not Windows.- A few basic tools are missing in the initial setup, e.g. system monitor.Conclusion:It was worth to try it, but for many daily tasks it's not suitable because of the mentioned con's.I see a lot of potential for the development, and I hope upcoming releases will improve. I'll keep monitoring this.I will return to Mint."
2378,2023-02-27, elementary OS, 7.0,1,10,"Sorry but this is a garbage operating system. Way too many issues ranging from hardware to software.They have made zero improvements in the nVidia realm. Screen tearing galore. WiFi issues have plagued this distribution for years for whatever reason and continue to be on issue. Same goes with Bluetooth.Pile this on top of an already troubled, stuttery user interface and buggy, lackluster default applications. There is just no way to take this seriously. App Store kinda sorta works when it wants. And if you're lucky enough to not take your system down you're met with very limited software.For beginners this is not. Be honest here... the out of the box experience is trash. You're going to have to spend some time to get it to a place of usability, functionality and if you're lucky, stability. Just too much work required for this one."
2379,2023-02-24, elementary OS, 7.0,8,1,"Elementary OS has some ups and downs, but mostly I find myself enjoying the default experience and I'll probably stick with it for quite some time.The ""AppCenter"" is a flatpak ""app store"" style application that has a decent variety of software designed specifically to fit the design they're going for in elementary, and there's usually at least 1 of each type of application you could want readily available. Since these are flatpaks you can go to the flathub website and download a flatpak from there, which will cause AppCenter to begin to show the full Flathub library on top of its own library. I found this to be kind of necessary when all was said and done, since popular applications like Firefox, Steam, Discord (yuck) aren't available anywhere in the default AppCenter library. I understand why they have only a limited selection of applications, as it provides a more curated experience, but I can't say I'm a huge fan of the decision not to provide something as simple as Firefox (it it was a decision, at all). I have been using some of their own AppCenter programs as an alternative to the ones I'm used to and they have worked very well and looked very nice for the most part, so I'm pretty happy with a lot of the software they do provide, regardless. If required, you can also install software through apt on the command line since behind the scenes it's based on Ubuntu, but if you're here, you're probably wanting something a little less reliant on using the command line to begin with.The Pantheon desktop environment looks, feels, and sounds really nice. Touchpad gestures feel great and the animations are nice and smooth on my 2017 gaming laptop. I've had no issues with hardware support, either. The choice to have the Close button on the left and the Maximize button on the right and Minimise button to be just clicking the application icon on the dock took a little getting used to, and I think it could be a tripping up point for some people, but it's not really an objectively bad decision when it comes down to it, and if you really hate it you can install ""Pantheon Tweaks"" to add a new set of options to the System Settings application that can change it to Mac style, Windows style, whatever you need.There are, however, some features completely missing from the Settings application that I hope are implemented in a future edition of elementary. The VPN settings only offers OpenVPN as an option, so configuring Wireguard or some other type of VPN directly in the settings application is out. Also missing is Bluetooth PAN connection settings, so while you can access the menu for regular old Bluetooth pairing, connecting to and disconnecting from a Bluetooth network is not an option in the settings app. Thankfully, because elementary is using Network Manager in the background, you can still configure or activate these networking options on the command line or with nmtui if you prefer (slightly more) graphical ways to do it. There are issues for both of these missing features already on their Github repository, but time will only tell if these are implemented in time for the next version.All-in-all, despite some trip ups that require usage of the command line (it is Linux, after all), elementary is a distribution that feels like the small team of developers really care about providing something outside of the status quo. Pantheon being developed right alongside the distribution makes things feel tight and clean in a way that many distributions don't achieve.There's a vision here, and despite some clouds, the developers are well on their way to realising it."

When the pacifier stopped the progress bar (embedded in the Cancel button) also stopped.  My next step was to reboot. This performance occurred multiple times.  I'm still not certain that all the updates have been implemented.(2)  Firefox NEVER turned up in the ""Internet"" category of available applications.  Really?  I fixed this in a VERY inappropriate way:         $ sudo apt-get install firefox(3)  A little research at this point revealed that Snap and/or Flatpak might have been more appropriate.  So I'm now confused: how are packages supposed to be managed in version 7???At the end of all this, both machines got updated and configured.  But it appears that elementary OS v7 provided LESS functionality than v6.  It appears that v7 needs MUCH more terminal fiddling (apt-get etc) than version 6 ever needed.  Is this progress?"

I'm in love with the gorgeous desktop pantheon and what excites me the most is the integrated apps like notes and tasks.The use of flatpaks is definitely a good move but I would like to see the debian or core Ubuntu apps in the already nice looking app centre.I am certainly eager to see what version 7.0 will bring to the table but for now this definitely deserves a solid 9.To make this distro a perfect 10 it would need the debian and Ubuntu apps ready in there software Centre rather than isolating you to there only hand picked flatpaks (currently about 90), also the pantheon tweak tool should be installed as standard and a selection of themes would be nice as I find myself adding gtk3 themes myself to enhance the pantheon desktop even more.Libre office needs to be pre installed too and I would like to see a simple gui welcome screen app that gives you the option to install popular apps such ass Google chrome, Spotify and so on.To get my Google drive to sync I end up having to install and trigger gnomes online accounts app as the provided one is hit n miss.Nemo should also be the default file manager and this is mainly due to its ability to do greater things such as root access to a folder etc.Although snaps are mainly for Ubuntu this is an Ubuntu based distro so the snap store gui would be a welcome site too or better still have snaps appear in the elementary os app centre and let the end user decide if they prefer the flatpak, snap or deb version.All in all its my daily driver on my macbook and I am keen to see this turn in to a great OS.

Third party software, my bread and butter, it complained about, but finally gave in to my demands. It's like that critical day at boot camp, Parris Island,where a lot of ambition counts, with a heaping spoonful of muscle. I'm going to love Elementary, especially since I have its own grub and the one I installed on a USB stick. So I recommend this to intermediate level and above Linux users, but please fasten your seat belt.Love the Pantheon desktop. Whenever I have the Mate-desktop, I add a Panther-launcher, virtually the same thing as Elementary's Pantheon. This is a UI for 2022. I believe it's at Rastersoft.

One of the most important pieces of software on a PC and Elementary completely screws it up. App center is hit or miss if it will work. Very poor performance. Unstable. A nightmare to customize. problematic networking issues and doesn't work well at all with VPN's. Just no longer worth the download. It is a complete waste of time. The developers have absolutely ZERO interest in making it better or listening to users feedback.

Briefly tested their Urbino and 10 versions in VMs. They are both based off LMDE5 just with diferent theming options so the overall experiences are very similar.Installation process was flawless for both versions. You run the installer, go through various steps in the installer and you'll get it installed with absolutely no issue.After booting into the installed system, that's when I started to encounter some issues. I was at first attempting to update the system, but some mirrors cannot be fetched due to 403 time out. I then went ahead and tried updating packages that it fetched successfully. At the end of the process I was hit with errors regarding linux-image-5.10.22-amd64 package along with initramfs-tools. I was assuming that something was wrong with the kernel download, maybe the download was corrupted, so I tried to purge it and download it again. However, I ran into the same error when running the purge command.Then after searching on the internet for some time, I found a post about having live-boot on installed systems. That's when I tried to run the command `sudo apt purge live-boot-initramfs-tools` and indeed both `live-boot-initramfs-tools` and `live-boot` packages are installed on the system. After purging those packages the system returns normal, with packages can be updated and installed with no issue.To me this looks like an oversight from the Ufficio Zero team as in the description of `live-boot` package it clearly states that this package shouldn't be installed on non-live systems. It's not a huge issue if you know what to look for on the internet, but for average users that got hit with those error messages just because they want to update their systems, I would say it still looks somewhat intimidating especially since it's related to the linux kernel, based on what the error message states.Long story short, if you want to use Urbino version or 10 version, after installing the system make sure you run `sudo apt purge live-boot-initramfs-tools` before updating your system to get rid of packages that are not supposed to be on installed systems. (I also tested the latest Tropea version and that one works fine when you update the system so no extra action is needed.)"

The only difference I see are a few extra programs, and some picturesque wallpapers. It's sad that so many developers are taking existing distros and slapping on a few new graphics and photos, and passing them off as something new. What a waste. If they want to do something innovative, how about making a user friendly version of Slackware, or Gentoo from the ground up."

2419,2023-03-24, Guix System, 1.4.0,10,11,"
Hello everyone,I have been coaxed into writing a review by reading some of the other recent ones - I found them fair and measured, but had one or two little factual points to add. One reviewer, in a generally excellent review, makes the comment that Guix is heavy on the CPU/Internet Bandwidth, and that it is not to be recommended for old computers. I have two very relevant personal anecdotes to share on this.Anecdote 1: My main machine is a Librebooted Lenovo X200, the classic chunky Thinkpad, and I have been running Guix with the Gnome desktop on it for nearly two years now, and it has been absolutely fine for all my usage. Before that I had been on various things, even going through a phase when I was trying out the less-free ""light"" distros (before I librebooted it). Guix was similarly smooth and quick as anything I'd tried (xubuntu, lubuntu, pureos, manjaro).That said - I don't play computer games, I don't edit videos, and at the upper limit I might have ten tabs open, but it's rare. All other usage however - watching videos, listening to music, programming, writing, Emacsing, Info-page trawling; Guix is a joy on this old X200 for all that.Anecdote 2: Last night I was installing Guix on a new laptop, a Lenovo 2016 X1 Yoga, and decided to time it for fun. I went through the graphical installer, added the five available lightweight window managers because I want to try them all (EXWM, ratpoison, i3, awesome, openbox), and then I was rebooting into a fresh machine in... 20m49s.20m49s from booting the USB with the ISO image to booting a fresh Guix. That is pretty snappy, I personally feel.The other point is that - EXWM should be included in the ""Desktop"" section above, it is an option in the installer!Last point (that makes four in the end?) I was actually quite close to a total beginner when I started using Guix, and it was perfectly fine for me. I didn't know anything above the absolute basic commands for installing software for months and months, and it was grand. Gnome is solid.Here I am, two years later, and the other day I packaged my first package. So yes, do join us, and get involved, Guix is wonderful, the documentation is great, the community are lovely. Software Freedom can be sleek and cool and exciting :)"
2420,2023-03-22, Guix System, 1.4.0,10,0,"GNU Guix is by far the most underrated distribution as of now. There is quite nothing like it in the ""market"". Using GNU Guix has made my life easier, allowing me to easily keep my devices configurations and packages in sync. I admire the fact that it treats Linux as just a kernel, which you have the option to switch with different ones, or just different versions of it, be it linux-libre, linux-lts or any other version with proprietary drivers you might like. It made me understand the point of view of FSF, and now it clicks. Even thought it's an amazing distro, it still does not have everything packaged, so you might need to use something like flatpak."
2421,2023-01-21, Guix System, 1.4.0,10,3,"Guix is an underrated distribution, probably the most underrated distro as of now. There is nothing like it around, it offers you complete control of your system and reproducibility like no other, all with a general purposed programming language, scheme!  The downside of using guix, is that the official iso only supports the linux-libre kernel. You are going to have to search around for nonguix or just follow along system crafters installation video to get it working properly with the linux-nonfree kernel. As much as I appreciate FSF ideals, this is a huge barrier for the average user, that just wants something that works."
2422,2022-12-27, Guix System, 1.4.0,9,5,"Guix is definitely an advanced distribution. I would recommend familiarity of Linux before trying it out. Not having the regular /bin and /usr directories, and having the store for all packages, can make for some interesting bugs.Documentation: yes, it's the odd info format, but it is very detailed. Would recommend reading it entirely before installing!Hardware: Guix is one of the brave fully libre distros. The installer should tell you if your computer is unsupported. If it is unsupported, search the internet for workarounds. Also, Guix does demand some CPU/internet bandwidth. Would not recommend on an old computer.Installation: rather straightforward ncurses terminal interface. If you need something complicated like BTRFS subvolumes you can always install it the ""Arch way"" (by hand).Desktops: GNOME and XFCE work well. KDE is coming soon, can't wait. If you like i3 and Sway, Guix has these too.Packages: Lots of emacs and R packages, great for data scientists. You should be able to find most of what you need. There's flatpak and even the nix package manager if you can't find what you are looking for. Guix is not always up to date, but there are guix commands to help try out the latest package if it is not updated yet.Managing system:  1. declarative home/system configuration: No more hunting around the /etc folder for configuration files, just write them to a single file.  2. Configuration rollbacks: make a mistake? reconfigure your system and fix it that way.  3. guix shell. Install and try packages (without root!), no need to commit them to your installation if you don't like them.Development: If you know coding, hacking on the packages and helping to upgrade them is fully documented. It's Guile Scheme, study the packages with guix edit and you'll learn. Guix uses a mailing list for patches. It is not like GitHub, but I think it is much faster.Give it a try! I bet you will learn a lot. You might even like it :)"
2423,2022-11-30, Guix System, 1.3.0,7,0,"Got a functional install of Guix the first time around, so that's a plus. Am reasonably certain Guix is great on sufficiently adequate hw for most of the 24x7 GitHub crowd.Ended up not expanding system by doing further configuration tweaks and bulking down system with further pkgs.Otoh, would give the Guix distro a gcc ""C"" b/c at least 1) its going off the deepend complexity, and 2) didn't and don't really want to go through hoops to store flatfile configuration database locally (or on removable, storable media) as opposed to default online on The Cloud non-locally.Very OK right now with the manageable complexities of Archlinux and Voidlinux instead."
2424,2022-09-04, Guix System, 1.3.0,9,4,"The reality is that the system is fairly complex for the average user. That being said, it also provides the space and place to really delve into programming from an academic approach as far as available learning resources. There is no better place to wade into the deep end. More typing yes. More control, more opportunities to accelerate DIY training...YES!!I've used & installed every Linux distro I could get my hands on, basically every one sans Qubes... That one is still scary for me, LOL. BUT, Guix will keep a veteran sharp and offer noobs a conceptual reference. Guix System is a great way to focus on guix/guile. Alien Guix, as a package manager is also fantastic when paired with a decent linux distro. Worked great with libre-linux on ParrotSec and my favorite to date is Trisquel 10 w/ Guix(from a use and non tinker standpoint. I also really loved using GUIX with GhostBSD.... All in all, guix is an amazing tool as a system or package manager. And, I'm as a lay a user as they come. I've DIY'ed myself into Junior Administration. Discovering and delving into guix may be overwhelming on approach, but nothing else accelerated my learning like guix and low level code. If you don't want to be a monkey pushing buttons for someone else who knows the details, and really know why you are doing what you do as a programmer or an administrator, I'd think GNU/GUIX(GUILE) is requisite. I hope to be a superuser, and I can thank GUIXSD for getting closer to becoming a true professional, and avoiding becoming an opinionated schmuck like oh so many rushed into the space via bootCRAMP..

2425,2021-10-09, Guix System, 1.3.0,9,14,"My first steps into gnu and linux I had 20 years ago. I started once with REL and SUSE. 10 years ago I gave debian gnu/linux and ubuntu a go and actually trisquel 9 and manjaro are my daily drivers. I'm an ordinary user but no coder. BTW: English is my fourth language so please be patient with me. This now is a laudatio to push forward the gnu operating system guix. In my mind and in the beginning gnu guix might be a bit strange and seem to be made for more experienced linux folks but if you are no terminal hater, you might fall in love with gnu guix soon. Its attitude and setup ideas are great and 1.3-0 now is both stable and elegant. I've tried out Gnome, Mate and Enlightment and all of them are running stable. Personally I'm a Mate fan but with gnu guix I even made peace with Gnome Desktop - and Enlighment, well this is a real big and positive surprise to me. So in other words I'd like to invite you and you (U2!) to give gnu guix an early go."

Ok, so I used BeOS 5 Professional as my main diver back in the day and actually even used it as the heart of my PC media center. Then BeOs died :-(I just installed R1-beta4 and was pleasantly surprised to see that it feels like my old system, only better and very responsive. Compared to previous iterations B4 actually works quite well. I tried Libreoffice,  Krita, TexStudio and GIMP without any major issues. I also found that Youtube worked on the Otto Browser, which I frankly didn't expect. Games like Sonic Robo Blast 2 and Otto Matic bought back memories and I even installed Yabasic and Algol 68G!Overall, this project is making significant progress towards a truly stable and usable system. I don't think I will give up  FreeBSD or Linux just yet, but I will be installing this operating system permanently onto a spare drive on my 32GB Dell Optiplex to test it long term and maybe even do some actual work!"
2429,2023-01-26, Haiku, R1-beta4,10,16,My family's daily operating system... My children love Haiku and use it for computer programming. Very good apps I've used on Haiku:Office:---------- Grafx - paint program- GIMP - image editor program- Inkscape - vector/bitmap graphics editor- LibreOffice - word processing/spreadsheets - Scribus - desktop publisher- Strawberry - multimedia and internet radio player- Medo - movie/video editor- Wonderbrush - vector/bitmap graphics editorInternet web browsers:-------------------------------- Epiphany
2430,2023-01-24, Haiku, R1-beta4,8,10,"I have been watching Haiku for many years now,Beta 4 is finally a usable operating system, in many ways superior to various Linux distros:Consistent, database - like file system (inherited from BeOS - still unbeatable)A lot of working applications from Office to Web (Gnome WEB seems the best choice for now, WEB Positive is still work in progress).It is very fast  even on old hardware and supports enough hardware to run on many machines.Hardware support is getting better by the month, modern USB,  Network, Sound  and WifI chips are quite well supported.UI is and always was nice and consistent, customizations are decent (work in progress).Command line is very good and supports most features from other Unix-like OSsFor a single - user system with needs to communicate, write, design graphics or just listen to music and watch videos - perfect choice with not much headaches.For a programmer or tinkerer - great system to add to it, expand and customize.Since Haiku hired high quality developer and has wonderful active community - all goes into the direction of truly mature and usable OS.I take to points off simply because there are still many smaller bugs (mostly in apps, the core system is stable) to be sorted out (well - it is BETA 4, not release)"
2431,2023-01-20, Haiku, R1-beta4,10,7,"With the latest release, Haiku R1/beta 4, Haiku has become a fully usable operating system.  It is pretty stable and has the basic software that most people need, such as a good web-browser (Gnome/Web/Infinity - I wish they would use just one name), Libre0ffice, Gimp, etc., etc..It's VERY fast, even on ancient hardware.  It's much easier to use than any version of Linux, and it doesn't spy on you. Bear in mind that this is a Beta release, so things will get better and better.  For me, now, as a general-purpose, everyday OS it is just what I need, and I am delighted to finally get out of the clutches of the robbers barons of Redmond."
2432,2023-01-16, Haiku, R1-beta4,8,7,"I used  BeOS at university in the 90s. I always loved the interface and development of simple applications was straightforward. As such I have been following the progress of Haiku, the open source remake for the last decade. However, I felt it was never suitable for desktop general use, until R4 was released.I was amazed by how fast this R4 booted on my ancient single core Atom 160 machine with 1GB RAM and even thought the SIS graphics was not recognised, the interface response is basically near instant.The included browser WebPositive is a little janky and doesn't play Youtube on this old dog of a PC. And you have to select your hardware carefully if you want wireless access.However, as a standard desktop client, with LibreOffice, mail and web browser and most Epson and Canon printers all working out of the box via gutenprint, this odd relic from the 1990s is amazingly spritely. Final verdict on R4:It has been very stable, VERY VERY quick and is finally generally usable. Although, HW support is sadly still lacking in many areas.I'll give it an 8 becuase it's such a simple, practical OS and harkens back to the simplicity and purity of function that many distros lack today."
2433,2023-01-01, Haiku, R1-beta4,6,2,"I like and love haiku,but you can only vote for what you have with haiku. Since Beta 4, my network cards are unsupported (unstable and keep connecting and disconnecting in seconds), this is not fun and keeps me from using the current Haiku version.I've been with Haiku since the beginning, writing tutorials and programming with the yab programming language. I'm also running the Haiku hardware list with a friend and we're collecting and adding hardware reported by users.Haiku is a great system, ok for me, the beta is a step backwards but not for everyone, changes to support newer hardware have broken older things, this is normal and I need to find a supported NIC to use the beta 4.Haiku is simple, not complicated, small, fast, and the steps each beta takes are wide and good. Many things came to Haiku over the years, like LibreOffice and others.And yes, Haiku doesn't have direct hardware support, but I can play Minecraft with no problems.Give Haiku a chance and take a look."
2434,2023-01-01, Haiku, R1-beta4,8,6,"Runs well on my old HP Stream. The UI feels incredibly responsive and I enjoy using it. Honestly, I can't explain exactly why I like the interface but I have started using it for simple office tasks (LibreOffice installed and runs fine) because I enjpy it. Also, the lack of options helps me stay on task. I'm running it off a good quality USB drive. I have had a few issues with HaikuDepot crashing and installs failing but the recent update has helped lessen these issues somewhat. For me the install was easy. My suggestion to anyone thinking of trying Haiku on real hardware is to Read the Haiku Wiki Hardware Section ------- Read the hardware compatibility section. If it isn't on that page, don't expect it to work. This OS runs well on old hardware if it is compatible and drivers exist. I should say that I mostly just use Linux and stumbled on Haiku while I was searching for a hardware issue on with this laptop. It seemed interesting and I have been using it for simple office tasks and am surprised by how much I enjoy the experience."
2435,2022-12-26, Haiku, R1-beta4,1,0,"anyboot.iso will not boot with EFI firmware in QEMU/KVM.  Since all my real hardware is UEFI only with no CSM available, which makes it completely useless IMO.  Modern hardware runs on UEFI, most doesn't support CSM/classic boot anymore.  Pretty much pointless to bother with an OS that doesn't support most of the hardware made in the last 3-4 years.Still don't see how the devs promote this as a usable OS given it's massive limitations.  I know it's still beta, but beta should at least have the capability to be installed on real hardware."
2436,2022-07-19, Haiku, R1-beta3,3,1,"It's waste of time unless you know how convince Haiku Comunity to do something with it for real. It's as bad and as useless as BeOS was in past. You can boot from EFI, you can connect to WiFi, you can use on more modern hardware but you cant do anything about it. It's unstable, specially HaikuDepot when you install more apps, once you install after couple months update repo will be dead end no longer giving you way to upgrade. Pretty but useless. It's easy to replicate once you install, replicate to USB and install back to HDD. Preffer Slax over it because if you install Slax to USB stick you still can use this stick but also add modules, remove problematic modules. You cant do it with Haiku if you make mistake by installing unstable app you may get in trouble and need to instal it again fresh clean just as you had to Windows 98. For Windows or Linux we have Marcium Reflect. For Haiku? No such thing. UI people make so much fuzz about, is actually very BAD, ideas are just bad, the ""Start button"" and short window title bars might be good idea. Might if was combined with other elements inteligently such as vertical task bar. Imagine KDE with Panel on right top of screen with all buttons on it. And title bars of windows on left side of screen this might work. But Haiku wont allow maximized window to cover entire screen but also titles of maximized windows will remain hidden one under another. It remain unchanged since BeOS and Haiku developers dont see need to change it a bit.. System is like zoombie, or a vampire. How to make it alive or kill it? It doesnt and wont ever have hardware 3D OpenGL Vulkan OpenCL nor of these things. Should be small OS for VirtualBox, small host for PHP, Node.JS or whatever server but it wont ever have priviliges for users it only have one user. Should be based on Linux or BSD core with Haiku API added it's idea kept alive but waiting for someone to make use of it. At curent state it makes no difference BeOS, Haiku 2010, Haiku 2022.. nothing practically ever change. Try, see and forget."

I can understand it being a beta, so it’s not perfect and it doesn’t have a lot of people working on the development team, but I give the developers a lot of credit for trying their best and it not being another Linux-based distro. I look forward to seeing Haiku keep progressing."

Also would be nice to list a consolidated page of hardware computers that are compatiable and work with the haiku drivers. I went to the haiku web site and and when trying to find the hardware support page it took tome to 2 url sites that were canceled out and kept redirecting me to yet another page. Pleas post a page with all known working laptops and desktops that haiku will work with. Even after finding some that were listed, it took a while to stream through the listed (very poor list put together). Another thing that would help haiku get some business going is to have a pc hardware building dept for those who would like to buy a modern computer that have all the hardware necessary to run-ou-of-box. This way, all drivers would be satisfied. The user would be happy and rock his world :o)I know its only beta stage but there is so little hardware support and most of what has been recommenced to work is legacy computers.

2441,2021-07-28, Haiku, R1-beta3,7,1,"Some 20 years ago I used BeOS 4.5 and was amazed! Afterwards I bought BeOS 5, the GoBE productivity suite and the weighty BeOS bible. At the time it beat Windows 98SE hands-down in speed, agility and performance. It was a pain getting drivers for the hardware though and applications were sparse. Over the years Windows took over the workflow, BeOS moved to the archives. So I was extremely pleased to see it revived in Haiku. Would the recent beta 3 release be a decent candidate for a daily desktop system?The positive news: it installed effortless on the HP 15xx laptop, as it did on the Asus X75V. Alas..there are still a lot of issues. How ""clear"" or ""fuzzy"" fonts and display appear, depends on the graphics card and monitor. The Asus delivered far better results than the HP (AMD Radeon). However, on the two tested machines only the build-in PCI LAN cards were recognized (RTL 8111  for the HP and Atheros 813 for the Asus), it failed to see both onboard wifi cards (RTL8723 DE and a generic Realtek that does show up in networkmanager but without finding any networks). So I can only use Haiku as long as I have a wired connection to the net. Webpositive is slow and crashed several times while trying YouTube videos. It still does not display them full screen and they still have bad image quality. Both the command line update as well as the GUI updater got stuck while trying to upgrade the Italian user guide. I wish they had split this into multiple packages because I do not have a need for the Italian user guide, still, the update seems to come only in an all-or-nothing deal.I am aware that this is a beta test, but there is still a lot to straighten out. In the present state I could not use this as a daily desktop system, but rather as a hobby project. All of that being said, I am eagerly awaiting the next release and yes, kudos to the small community of people that are trying to bring an alternative OS."

I tried a few distros as a replacement for KXStudio (which I really liked and have used for over 5 years).  Install for usb was easy and straightforward.  There were a few tweaks needed to get some of the functionality with Jack that just worked in KXStudio but no real deal breaker there.  Ardour works well as it always seems to but having some named setups within plugins in KX meant that the plugin was not recognised in AVL; I still had my old distro running so could take a note the settings and update the new distro. All in all for audio production AVL is great.Found issues getting Wine to work properly, mostly from fonts in Windows packages not being recognised.  I needed to add fonts to wine one at a time because some just won't install.  This is still work in progress.M (Scotland)."

Most required infos are consolidated so that there is not  a lot of pop ups requesting for infos.Usage: Menus and options are placed properly. Standard Xfce4 menus but organized properly. Right mouse click menus are nice but seems crowded to me for some reason.CONS:Since I tested this out on VMware, the only issue I have is that the internet is not working. I have gone into networking settings and checked the internet card. The status on it says that it is enabled but for some reason it still cannot reach the internet. I tried enabling dhpcd and it say file is missing (along that line).  I tried other internet solutions that people seem to recommend but still no connection. I can't remember too much if other distros that I have come across have an internet problem, especially using VMware. For the time being, I'll wait to see if other people have the same issue as me using VMware.Not being able to connect to the internet for any distro at this point is a major downer so I can took 3 points off.I know that there are many nic  cards out there but I think vmware nic is almost the same for as long as I've used it and there has not being internet issue with it for me for many distros that I have tried out.Overall:The distro is very professional looking and would  impress many people to use it.

For example a 500mb file could take perhaps 15-20 mins using Avidemux whereas Handbrake would take several hours for a inferior picture quality.I highlight Avidemux because it is THAT good, now for sure you can install avidemux on other distros which I have used it on such as Mint and Peppermint, however Avidemux will not be available for all distros and in my experience getting Avidemux to work, even if it can be installed is not always successful because of various issues with dependencies etc.As far as I am aware AV Linux is the only disto (please correct me if I am wrong) that has a working Avidemux ""out of the box"".Having Avidemux as well as all the other useful packages such as Audacity, K3b, xfburn out of the box is brilliant because it means you not, only do you get a properly working package, you don't have to worry whether Avidemux or K3b is available to install or whether the package becomes obsolete.I have taken steps to not only have AV Linux on my Ventoy live USB but I have also got the AV Linux ISO on Data DVD (those shiny silver discs and also uploaded a copy to the cloud (just in case!)A big thumbs up to all those who brought us AV linux, MX linux and of course Avidemux!Pros :  Brilliant ""Out of the box packages"" that are not available elsewhere.Cons: None for what I use AV linux for!KL Oxford UK"

As clunky as it was i could use it pretty well. I liked it. A lot. During that 7 years I periodically looked at the alternatives but would always just roll back to the latest AVL. Not any more. It took a jump into a different market space. MX. So this time I spent a lot of time comparing the systems before i installed Ubuntu Studio. I'm using the latest. I brought this install up to my everyday use level (multiple cameras, JACK feeds,ARDOUR,virtual cams,STEAM games,google drive,) in low hours replacing many hours of fooling with AVL and never quite getting everything. I've still got AVL ready to install but so far i do not fancy its chances. Watch this space. If I come back and comment it may be useful.Pros: I know how it works, if you take the time you'll find it has everything for audio work you might wish for.Cons: This version now uses a low latency kernel.

The lighter desktop also sparked my interest as a possible midway point betwwen midweight distros like MX and genuine lightweight ones like Antix.Turns out that's exactly what it is, all the MX tools and extra goodies I like, but snappier than full XFCe MX Linux. Of course it would be overkill if you don't need that kind of extra software, but still a valid option if an old beast can't quite cope with straight MX Linux. Even on a small SSD which I invariably use on older PC's, the extra software doesn't really impact on the size that much - a GB or so extra.I might even remove most of that software and remaster the ISO into a more general purpose thing because it's quite impressive.

I use to use KDE Mint and Feren comes the closest to that and has improved greatly on it. One of the most beautiful distros Ive seen and the modified Win11 style desktop is very nice as well as the Feren theming. Its the best KDE distro Ive tried and stays far more up to date with kernel and KDE versions, than other Ubuntu based distros. No issues with install(uses Calamares), update or hardware detection and the added Mint features are really nice, like the updater and troubleshooter. So many nice themes with this distro and the level of customization is something very appreciated.Codecs you can install when installing the distro and I had no multimedia issues at all. System feels noticeably faster than many of my other distros and memory usage was reasonable at 830mb. Typically I would note a few cons about this distro but honestly there werent any in my use and the pros far exceeded my expectations. KDE users, former Mint users, new users and inexperienced users will find Feren easy to use and a great daily driver to get things done. Its using the KDE 5.25.5  and the 6.1 kernel but the 7.2023 version I understand will upgrade these further. App selection is good, with everything you need to get up and running out of box, including LibreOffice and Firefox. At first boot the welcome screen will greet you and help you familiarize yourself with the distro. Honestly cant figure out why this distro is rated so low on Distrowatch as its far better than some other KDE distros like Mageia at 27. Please give this distro a try and see what you think."

System updates are frequent enough, which shows that the distro is being maintained well and your system are kept up-to-date.The only problem I have is with the Calamares installer. It worked fine with one of my laptop and crashed on my second, newer laptop, making it unbootable. Took me a while to fix that. I have no problem with the Ubiquity installer at all."

I tried multiple distros before settling on Feren.On this particular system, Feren is the only distro I tried that installed properly, booted cleanly after installation and still continues to run smoothly. Each of the others I tried - Debian and Arch derivatives - failed to start after installation for some weird reason and in some cases wouldn't even boot into live mode. I have previously worked with all of the other distros I tried to load and for some odd reason they just didn't work this time even though they work fine elsewhere. I believe there is an underlying hardware issue but Feren seems to be more robust than the others I tried in bringing this system up to a reliably operational state.Once booted, the desktop loads smoothly and everything works nicely. I have had no problems loading applications, installing additional tools from the repositories, and using the system with various external hardware devices including mass storage, pointing devices and keyboards, the printer, docking stations, and external displays. Wireless connectivity and Bluetooth also work very reliably. Everything just works like it's supposed to work.As a daily driver, this is a fine system. I use it for surfing the web, editing documents, and software development. My hardware is capable of virtualization but I haven't attempted that under this distro yet.I have no problem recommending Feren, particularly if you're having subtle hardware issues with a system and are having trouble loading other distros."

2472,2023-02-08, Feren OS, 2022.10,10,3,"The best Plasma DE distro I've come across so far. Basically it's as if  Linux Mint had kept their KDE spin going,Ubuntu LTS base with a decent, but not bloated, set of default apps (Vivaldi is my preferred browser, so it being the default is a big plus for me).Less buggy than Neon (track pad is fully functional and display settings stay in place)  and without the near daily updates. More stable than Manjaro and seems to be well supported (unlike Solus - which now seems to actually be dead).Though it may seem like an odd choice for a KDE based system, personally, I like the use of Mint tools and the Nemo file manager - it's like the developer asked me which tools to substitute the KDE versions for.Very nice default aesthetic -  better than standard Plasma Breeze and a definite step up from Manjaro or Solus customizations. I did change the panel configuration and the launcher app, but i've otherwise kept the defualt customization.  There are a number of preset DE configs in the Appearance pane of system settings, including Ubuntu and Mac clones, so DE arrangement is pretty easy if you don't want to go down the detailed settings rabbit hole.It's been very smooth running so far, which is a pleasure considering the relative bugginess/instability of many Plasma based distros.Very highly recommended in general and if you are a Plasma fan in particular, you're doing yourself a disservice if you don't take this for a spin.

2473,2022-12-27, Feren OS, 2022.10,10,0,"I've given Feren a solid 10 and it's well deserved. Many people who try it may moan and state its not rocking the latest Ubuntu base but bare in mind the current Ubuntu base 20.04 LTS is supported until 2025 with additional support as far as 2030 so is this really an issue🤔 no in my eyes. The development of feren os is that of a stable well established solid operating system and that's its edge over the others and why more people should be downloading and using. The kernel is 5.15 so follows Ubuntus kernel release cycle and again makes it very solid and robust out of the box.The desktop is beautifully designed and the system overall is not bloated. I like the way the developer thinks with this system, stable, beautiful and solid.The easy browser install tool is a great feature and of course being kde open many doors to customisation but you will find it's not needed because the default theme is perfect.The Linux mint kernel tool is also shipped with this system which allows you to switch your kernel should you want to.So download it and stick it on a USB and install. For those struggling getting a booting USB if you have an android phone then install etcher from playstore and using a USB c to USB adapter plug into your device and flash the image using etcher to your USB. Works every time for me without fail and remembering you'll need to format before flashing or writing the image iso to the USB.Anyway it's a brilliant system and needs to be amongst the top ten distros.

I don't like distro hopping and I don't like having to fiddle with the system BIOS to get it set up just to load a distro every couple of months, and after reading a positive write-up on Feren OS I decided to give it a shot. So far it is working out well for me.Install was smooth and easy. I was able to boot and install from a USB stick without endlessly messing with BIOS settings, a welcome change from the mess I have endured over the last several installs. I wasn't expecting to be asked to set up the first user account after installation had already required a reboot, but this was more of a surprise than a problem. The end result is the same.I really like KDE Plasma which was a big draw. Once up I was in familiar territory and everything just works. When I plug in my external monitor via HDMI the system correctly extends the desktop to it which is exactly what I want.And, so far no issues with updates that break the system hopelessly. I am hopeful that I can keep the system free from broken updates (and full reloads) for a while.Feren OS is my new daily driver for my system.

It includes the update manager from Mint and a kernel manager. The ubuntu base offers a wide offer of software.It is a little behind Kubuntu cycle of updates, but for me, that's of little importance.Overall, it seems like a good all-round distro for everyday use."
2477,2022-06-25, Feren OS, 2022.04,4,5,"I wasn't sure how to rate Feren.  I like its features a lot (so should I give it a good mark?).   I was ready to load it up as my primary OS.  Before I did so, I thought that I better check that it would see my printers and scanners.  I took this to be a mere formality, because I have NEVER had an issue with ANY Linux distro seeing my printers, which are a brand name (Epson) and which have been around for a while.  Guess what...Feren does not see my printers or scanners.  I tried to configure the printers manually, but Feren doesn't even list any of the drivers for this printer series (WorkForce)!.  So, what looked to be a great OS is basically useless (maybe I should have given it a lower rating).  FYI, I sent an email about this to Feren 3-4 days ago, but haven't heard anything back yet.  If Feren finds your peripherals, you will probably like it a lot, but be sure to try it first."

I did test it in a virtual environment and it looks really promising.  For me to be able to validate it completely it is important that it installs.  It is hanging on the display adapter and, while it is mostly the hardware, the kernel might miss some important modules."
2482,2022-01-25, Feren OS, 2021.10,5,1,"I'll say this about Feren: it looks pretty damn slick and it does provide a Windows migration option out of the box. Unfortunately, that's all I can say about it. I decided to test it out on a whim and ran into issues pretty quickly. Installation didn't go through on the first try, giving me an error and it took another one to complete. The boot menu was noticeably slower after the reboot, and so was the system itself in comparison to a few other mid-range distros I normally use; on my laptop it took several clicks on Install button in their app manager for a package to install because they just wouldn't register. The bluetooth wasn't working properly. I also had trouble running Spotify on Vivaldi due to some issues with widevine, though it ultimately worked after a few launches. Feren goes for a hybrid OSX/Windows interface with an OSX aesthetic but Windows' bottom app panel and titlebar buttons placed to the right. If you're familiar with both interfaces, this might give your OCD a run for its money; I tried placing the buttons to the left, which took a dozen attempts as the Titlebar buttons in Window Decoration settings was glitching out something awful. Cursors would change back and forth sometimes. To be fair, all this might be Plasma's rather than Feren's fault and I've seen this in other distros. But overall I gave up on it after an hour as I didn't find any redeeming qualities in comparison to some other faster and more stable distros. It's the little frustrations that add up and I'm glad this was not my first Linux experience, otherwise I could have been driven away from it. "

From the ranking, it seems a rather under-appreciated distribution under the ubuntu umbrella, but the developers did a great job of putting a fresh new look for the KDE lovers who prefer the stable point release cycle of Ubuntu rather than Manjaro. It looks elegant, customisable, efficient, with all the applications I am already familiar with. I wish I could give it a perfect 10, but the only piece missing is the a Feren focussed support community like you have for mint. There is a website for KDE users, but seems it is pretty inactive so that nobody asks or answers much, whereas if I put a query on Linux Mint forum, I am pretty much guaranteed a decent answer within 24 hour, which also motivates me to help others in return.

It is absolutely the best alternative to Windows, and if you are switching to Linux for the first time, this is the best Linux distro, better than Zorin OS trust me. It has tons of customization features, it unites all desktop layouts and even offers Windows 11 start menu called Doors. It has a browser manager that lets you easily install most major web browsers with single click. It has an awesome app store that has almost everything. I really don't understand why it is so underestimated. 10/10 fully deserved!"
2500,2021-09-26, Feren OS, 2021.07,9,4," I love Feren OS and have only had a few slight (to me) problems with it.  On a single machine I could not get it to install past setting up the locals until I retried it with no internet connection, then it installed just fine.  On all my machines I cannot get wine to work.  When it pops up, the window is super skinny and will not display anything.  This is happening when setting up a instance in PlayOnLinux.Besides that everything just works and works excellent.  Feren's version of KDE is beautiful.  I always preferred Cinnamon to KDE because I thought KDE was ""Chunky"" and disorganized, and always wished Cinnamon had the customization KDE had.  Feren's version fits the bill and is sleek and organized.  It is like the Cinnamon version of Gnome.I hope they keep up with the hard work because I will not be able to go back to another distro after this.  I installed Linux Mint and it just looks dated compared to Feren.  Windows has no chance!"

During the Upgrade it will pop up with a Notification that the PC should be Rebooted. It is best to just walk away and let the process continue to completion. Upon a reboot the Upgrade will continue showing a Per Centage progress bar. My system upgraded fine, the only fault I could see, after re-setting the Desktop to my theme, colour,icons, cursor, window decorations, etc., was that the icons on the Panel/system bar were overlapping a little and I needed to decrease the size of the Panel. Feren is a semi-rolling distro, sometimes doing automatic updates, other times necessiating manual intervention.

The system has numerous  settings and themes for personal preferences.  I would like to change the colour of the folders for easy identification. Overall very pleased, it works but could do with some system help. In the system help you will find a list of shortcuts. The system is easy to use though, new users would soon find their way around.

I like the fact that is KDE and Ubuntu  based.Cons:- In escalated UI, GTK applications don't look good: fonts are large, icons are small- The tech support is not good; it has a Discord channel attended by a single person, and there is no forum to check previous classified posts, good search mechanisms, knowledge. It makes you feel the distro is not that institutional, nor there is a will to have a proper support to end users. When asked to the only tech support person of plans to have a Forum web page, no answer. In this regard for example, Lunix Mint is far way better."

I was using Manjaro before I found out that the MHWD kept breaking the use of my Nvidia card. Even though Feren uses Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, my graphics card uses the proprietary software. Everything is smooth in Feren and I have yet to encounter a problem. Feren uses the latest 5.20.4 Plasma DE. I've been tempted to try out Garuda because of its similarity to Manjaro, but I'm satisfied with Feren. The best part about Feren is that default KDE themes are really great. I hate to spend countless time with customizing KDE themes. The themes by Feren are perfect to make the desktop look gorgeous. I definitely recommend Feren OS."

All there is is the install web browser option, again.In other words, it is not possible to install a web browser that can actually be used.This makes this operating system utterly useless.This is supposed to be a persistent live system.What is the point of an operating system that cannot run installed applications?This has proven itself to be a total waste of my time.First impressions count, EVERY time.Porteus used to be a great system that could be built online prior to download, so that one could have a ready to run operating system.Now, it is a static system that is effectively unusable for people who need a web browser to connect to the www.if I could make a request to the developer, it would be to either reinstate the 'Build Porteus' option on the website, or at least include a web browser pre-installed to the distribution.

2520,2022-04-15, Porteus, 5.0-rc2,10,14,"Actually rc3.Porteus is a rather brilliant system. Based on the 'daddy-of-all-distros', it is somehow one of the most modern of all of them.Porteus, being based upon Slackware, is effectively based upon source code, rather than heavy binaries; yet compiles easily.Porteus is light and powerful, rather than heavy and bloated. Where 'powerful' often means 'bloated' and slow, Porteus is very fast. The only thing that takes time is setting it up. But setting up always takes time.Porteus is both portable and live, but also installable to hard drive.Porteus doesn't try to be 'all-things-for-everyone', yet somehow just does that.Once it's played with, and its quirkiness is taken into account, Porteus is very user-friendly. It is clearly designed that way. So many things are made easy.Sure, repositories and package management could be better; but given that it is still a 'release candidate' & therefore effectively 'beta', it behaves more like a final 'gold' release, if not a 'gamma'. But maybe that's the developers' idea: a system that the end-user can customise to their hearts content.Some distros demand to be customised, giving the user the 'great responsibility that comes with great power'.Other distros are so bespoke that customising them breaks them.Porteus somehow surpasses all this. It can be played with and customised to the limits of what is available.And if I bork my install, then I can start afresh on the next boot, without even having to deliberately delete the saved configuration.Porteus is an 'idiot's dream', in the best way possible.If an idiot such as myself can somehow combine 15 years experience of Debian-based distros with Porteus, then I may make Porteus my main system. And that's a serious possibility.Perhaps the best thing is that I can do all of this on a pendrive, on the side and on the fly, while still keeping my stable main install intact.And then, once I've worked out my bespoke Porteus spin, I can install it to hard drive, and still have an identical version in my pocket.Actually, it is entirely possible to create a system whereby the main hardware is effectively a hub, with the operating system on one external drive, and the user partitions on other external drives. I have done this before, when a main HDD failed. I also did something similar this on a 4Gib EeePC netbook, with only the main install on the netbook, the user partition/data on an external drive.I may have to try this with Porteus. It'll probably be easier.Well done by the Porteus developers. You bring a refreshing perspective to the Linux ecosystem."

Porteus has all of the repositories and more, is easier to use, is faster and more stable. Porteus looks great and doesn’t use a ton of resources like Slackware does. In my experience, users in the Porteus forums are very helpful and nice and the developers are very active and open to users suggestions and comments. KDE is my preferred desktop environment and everything works great on it, and I would say as well that it’s speedy, very stable, is a cinch to use and has so much customization available for it.

Latest Porteus v-5.0rc3 doesn't show obvious differences on the surface, but even on a 13 year old laptop it performs brilliantly from a decent usb stick.  A choice of browsers are available to add on as modules, and my various Appimages work great as well - very useful for this type of system.  The release candidate doesn't have the USM package manager functioning, but does contain the current Slackware changes. Anyway, this quick booting snappy system is an advanced & modern portable offering with all the main DE's to choose from.  A generous amount of software is included for it's diminutive size together with security/privacy options. Another great release."
2525,2021-07-10, Porteus, 5.0-rc2,10,21,"I have always liked Porteus.  It's very small.  It's just a few hundred MB's in size which easily fits on a CD.  This is something that is becoming rarer and rarer nowadays.  It's very easy to install, and is much more refined than other small distros.  I would even venture to say that  it's the most polished, refined small distro out there.  It also runs beautifully on older PC's.  I even donated some money to the developers just because this is one distro that is absolutely worth supporting and keeping alive.Even though I am not using it at this very moment, I always enjoy going back to it, and always would like to have it as my Ace Card. "

Overall the menus are very simple and they have only a handful of the most useful programs installed. However, I was disappointed to see that there was no USM (Universal Package Manager) no longer being developed in this version 5 rc-2. This leaves me wondering how the heck would I update this distro? A package manager or update function is probably one of the most important elements of ANY distro. Other than that, this is a very decent modular style distro.

No fancy features as other unified communications solutions but do the job as publish in a easy way. It works with new and old hardware. No problem to be virtualized. Tons of third party harware from sip phones to sip gateways. Web UI for easy management but it let you fine tuning it from the command line. Can be enhanced with addins and modules most of them from third parties. Very stable due to being based on Centos but it need to upgrade to a new open source RHEL base Linux due to EOL of Centos.

Some of the aspects I like:    Privacy and Anonymity: Tail OS routes internet connections through the Tor network by default, which helps users maintain their privacy and anonymity online. It prevents websites from tracking user activities and location, and it encrypts all internet traffic, making it difficult for third parties to intercept or monitor online activities.    Security: Tail OS is designed with a strong focus on security, as it is built on a Linux foundation and incorporates various security measures, such as kernel-level firewall, automatic data encryption, and secure file deletion. It also provides a hardened environment for browsing, email, and other online activities, reducing the risk of malware and other cyber threats.    Portable and Live System: Tail OS is a live system, which means it can be run from a USB drive or DVD without installation on the computer's hard drive. This makes it easy to carry and use on any computer, while leaving no traces of user activity on the host system. It's particularly useful for users who need to use public computers or want to protect their data while using a borrowed or shared device.    Free and Open Source Software (FOSS): Tail OS is free to use and is based on open source software, which means that its source code is publicly available for inspection and auditing by the community. This enhances transparency, security, and trust in the software, as it can be independently verified for any backdoors or vulnerabilities.    User-Friendly Interface: Tail OS comes with a user-friendly interface that makes it accessible even for users with limited technical expertise. It provides pre-configured applications for secure browsing, email, messaging, and file management, making it easy for users to adopt secure practices without extensive technical knowledge."
2531,2023-03-21, Tails, 5.11,6,0,"Tor Browser is great for private/anonymous browsing and to have it combined with an OS on a bootable USB seemed like a really interesting idea. Well, the OS is clunky and outdated, and the Persistent Storage feature just doesn't work. Nothing ever gets saved into it. I spent a couple of hours fiddling with the configuration and rebooting and trying again. Persistent Storage is essential, otherwise you have to set your configuration every time you start and you can't retain bookmarks and file downloads from session to session. "
2532,2023-01-01, Tails, 5.8,2,18,"I used Tails quite a bit back in the day. After a while I just got tired of the promises and the endless glacial improvements. I have moved on.But despite that, I grabbed the 5.8 version the other day. I loaded it on a old slow USB drive. At first, it seemed to go ok.Where I ran off the rails was with trying to get and use bridges. It was suggested that I have the system send bridges to my 'gmail' account. I don't have a gmail account and won't get one. Anyone wanting to improve their privacy knows Google is not the place to start. For bridges, go directly to TOR. So I got the bridges, but Tails repeatedly refused to use them. In the past, bridges worked without a blink of complaint. Not for me, not this time.Bridges are a great help in unsafe environments. Not being able to get them safely and use them is not good for users.Tails still can't complete randomize the MAC address on start up. Yet, after start up one can go in to the network setting and completely randomize the MAC address after every connection! Really?The unsafe browser was another issue. I connected to the internet in a public setting with a border manager. Fine. I attempted to start the unsafe browser. It told me to connect first. So, to make sure I had a good connection, I reconnected yet again, only to get the same complaint. WAT???? In a public setting, the Unsafe browser is absolutely needed to connect. If the unsafe browser will not start, you are DIW...'dead in the water.' Meaning Tails is USELESS!*** The whole point of Tails is for it to work dependably while keeping the user reasonable safe in unsafe circumstances.***Also, ifconfig is gone. To manually change the MAC address, one has to wander through the IP command.Nothing about this thing is intuitive. Tails has great potential. However, the folks running the show there will never, ever realize that potential. Creeping, creaking development is not the solution either.My solution; I restarted my laptop, started Mint and applied a vigorous treatment of gparted to the Tails USB drive. Done!"

I like being able to rearrange the order of rectangles on the taskbar, and I like being able to see the rectangle's (task's) whole long title in a tooltip if I mouse over the rectangle.  (Why were so many GUI basics lost in later versions?)Good old Vidalia runs circles around ""Tor Circuits"" in terms of usefulness.  Which isn't really saying much, given that Tor Circus has zero functionality -- it's a purely read-only app.  (So there's no way to escape from a troublesome tor circuit.)Old Tor Browser makes it easy to spoof useragent via about:config.  Can't do that in the new one.  Old Tor Browser lets me save MP4s, but new one often gets served unsavable blobs.  Old one lets me wrap long lines in View Source; new one doesn't.  New one's default text font is far inferior.Old tails has a handy openPGP applet in the systray.  New one doesn't.  But its systray has a pull-down-list to select language.  :|Old tails' System Monitor shows me 4 32-bit cpu cores.  New one shows me 2 64-bit cores, but only 1 of them ever shows any activity.  :|older versions (3.13.2 and earlier) came with old ptivi video editor; new ones come instead with ffmpeg."

Tails OS surpasses Whoenix and Qubes when it comes simplicity, usability and functionality.

It’s hard to recommend a distro that flaunts that it’s for privacy when there are so many remote connections and other not private settings enabled by default and locked in the Tor browser.You definitely won’t be safe or secure if you use Tails.

2564,2022-09-02, TrueNAS, 12.0-U81,10,0,We having been using TrueNAS core for nearly 3 years and have been happy with their solutions.We use TrueNAS for VM disk and data storage as well as remote and local backups and comany file storage. It has been a pleasure working with TrueNAS systems.It has been reliable and solved many issues we were experiencing with alternatives.It has also allowed us to save money as we no longer need to keep upgrading storage on other machines as everything is nicely centralised and secured.We are busy implementing an additional TrueNAS server to add to the capacity and reliability of the product.
2565,2022-09-01, TrueNAS, 13.0-U1,9,0,"Using it since it was FreeNAS. Unfortunately or fortunately there is no better FOSS NAS/SAN software on the market. Using it for years at home and enterprise environments, and it proved a reliable and secure piece of software. I wouldn't trust my clients data, my VMs, the jails that manage my network and my home, the backups and my family ""digital treasures"" to it otherwise.Of course there are problems but the long term commitment of the team gives users a sense of stability and a proper insurance that those will be dealt with. And of course there is the stability itself provided by the upstream, all the development done and by ZFS itself.I can only hope nothing will happen to this direction in the future, the community lost so many other good projects over the years."

2567,2022-08-20, TrueNAS, 13.0-U1,9,1,"Coming from a Windows Server (and a little Ubuntu Linux) background, I was amazed by the way TrueNAS handles things. It just leaves no room for error. The hardware compatibility, because of FreeBSD, is excellent, way better than other solutions of the same type and even some well-known Type-I hypervisors.The stability of FreeBSD together with the amazing capabilities of ZFS and the easy setup of whatever one needs either through ready to use plugins (most of which are hassle-free) or the FreeBSD jail system is a ""killer"" combo. The separation of entities the jail system makes possible, together with the easiness of the GUI and the ZFS datasets, makes most deployments take a few hours long setting them up. Compared against the agonizing, tax-report-like approach of Windows and the endless patenting (MacGyver style) of most linux distros, easily leaves them in the dust.We are always talking about the stated purpose of the OS, which is NAS.Although, some of the functions a TrueNAS installation can perform, go above and beyond the role of a NAS appliance.Would recommend without hesitation. I will take a point off, though, just for motivational purposes, because the GUI has a lot of room to expand, and the CLI must be officially released sometime soon.Other than things that are already awesome and have the potential to become epic, I find no fault with the software."

Over the years that I've had it, I've run several updates and upgrades which have gone without a hitch.  My TrueNAS appliance is a valuable part of my backup regimen.  Ideally, an appliance like this just handles things quietly in the background and handles things without you having to get involved to keep that happening, and this does that well. The built-in GUI is quite user-friendly and presents the many options in a logical and easy to use format."

ZFS is amazing, just wish it supported on the fly expansion without adding entire vdevs or outright replacing disks one at a time.AD integration is extremely weak.  Backing out the integration is extremely broken.Let me start with the cons:* FreeNAS used to ship with Netdata installed.  It was pulled out before the re-brand to TrueNAS.  The built-in performance reporting isn't as comprehensive as Netdata was.* ZFS doesn't support expanding a pool by adding disks to a vdev (raid group).  You have to add a whole new vdev or replace disks one at a time with larger disks.* AD integration is extremely weak.  Not worth attempting, and when you do and try to back it out it doesn't work well and requires reboots to clear error messages.However, the pros:* ZFS* The UI is polished.

Thanks to the robust redundancy of OpenZFS, you’ll have the most redundancy possible for hardware failure giving you peace of mind in data security. This is something that Unraid and Synology don’t generally offer, definitely not at the same cost as a TrueNAS system.You can run TrueNAS on new or old consumer- or professional-grade computers. You can install TrueNAS however you’d like, instead of needing to use a USB drive like other solutions. This allows you to spend your budget on better hardware rather than software.TrueNAS also allows you to setup VMs and run third party apps, making it incredibly versatile and a no-brainer for the tech-enthusiast."

2574,2022-08-09, TrueNAS, 22.02.2,9,0,Builded my first TrueNAS Scale system lately. It was very easy to have it up and running. The best part is that I really can build the NAS that best fit my need and budget.There is a lot of information to gather if you plan on having a prosummer tier NAS. Some hardware choices can have limitations and not work exaclty the way you want. The forum is here to help you sorting out problems though.I have a new NAS with VM capabilities and I am able to make it evolve the way I need without having to change the whole thing and rebuy everything. That is a huge plus budget-wise.
2575,2022-08-08, TrueNAS, 22.02.2,10,0,"I've been using TrueNAS for the last 7+ years and it has run very well for me. The documentation was well written and it helped get my NAS up and running quickly. I found FreeNAS to be very stable, normally I ran the server on a UPS for power protection but a couple times when there was a power failure and I couldn't get the server shut down before the batteries ran out of charge.  Both times the server powered back up and there was no data loss. Initially I had been running a couple QNAP systems and when I built and transferred the files over to the FreeNAS server I actually had some bit rot issues with a couple files and lost the data on the QNAP NAS. Since then with my files on a ZFS server there has not been any file damage issues.Over the last couple years several HDDs have had errors reported by S.M.A.R.T. and replacing the drives have been straight forward to replace and rebuild.Last month I decided to build a TrueNAS Scale server and have things ever changed. The basic GUI is less cluttered looking, I find it easier to remember where various operations are located for example in the Data Protection area Scrubs, Snapshots, Replication, Cloud Sync, Rsync and S.M.A.R.T. can be configured. In FreeNAS these tasks were in multiple areas. The email reporting has been improved and is easier to set up. New notifications and any ongoing notifications are listed in a single email instead of several. Because Scale is Debian Dockers can be installed, also a half dozed Truechart applications are available and well over a hundred applications created by Truechart.org can be added. If anyone is going to try Scale and adding Truechart.org's additional apps, their getting started section suggests including stable and core trains so following their quick start guide is easier. I could get stable added as a preferred train but core would fail. One last improvement is the real-time graphs that are available from the Dashboard seem to be easier for me to read and monitor and if you want even more detail and information thee are several Truechart apps that can be installed.All-in-all I have found Scale to be a wonderful improvement and I plan on building another Scale server to replace the QNAP NAS, which I do like, but I prefer to have Scale as my NAS servers of choice. My initial FreeNAS server was built on an older IBM 3650-M2 with ECC memory and my Scale test server is actually running on a H.P. T730 thin client with 24GB of SODIMMs. The  drive bay is a Terramaster D4-300 4 bay enclosure with 2.5"" laptop drives instead of 3/5"" NAS drives. File transfer rates are running between 97-113 MB/s depending on the file size.I've been running Scale for 60 days so I'm still in a learning curve. So far the only thing I'd say was disappointing was the warning I read that even though the OS is Debian, it has been tweaked so it was recommended not to start installing .deb applications because it might affect the OS stability."

2585,2022-08-04, TrueNAS, 13.0-U1,10,0,"I’ve been using TrueNAS personally and professionally for 2+ years.  Was used to using systems/OS’s like Drobo’, Synology and QNAP.  What brought me to TrueNAS was it’s scalability and the fact that you can use the OS on any hardware and the ZFS file system.  I then started using it professionally, purchasing models like the MINI 3.0 + and the XL model.  Using it for it’s features like file shares for Mac OS or Windows SMB.  Being able to spin up a VM on a system is also an advantage of the OS.  Knowing that we can rely on the ZFS files system for system stability and recovery and scalability is a huge selling feature.  I use it as a personal file system and backups, I then have deployed and set it up for many of our clients, for SMB purposes, backup and replication purposes, disaster recovery purposes.  My personal system has 12 disks, using ZFS RAID-Z2, so allows up to 2 disk failures, I have 1 or 2 disk failures in the past and it was always easy to just hot swap a failed disk to get the array to rebuild.   I use my personal system for SMB shares with windows, integrating the snapshots easily so that I can access and use them via Windows shadowcopies.

Although this version is now considered deprecated, it continues to receive security patches from Debian LTS repositories.

I think that Xubuntu is underappreciated.

It can easily be tweaked to one's taste to a super looking and acting system.ProsRich repositories, archive versions for a sentimental trip to the past. Software center. Automatically mounted partitions.ConsThemes, panel, icons, wallpapers, windows that have had the same uninspired look for years.""Open as root"" could have been added to Thunar actions.

So my Xubuntu is going to be like a rolling release.I am using Xubuntu for years now. Its a working xfce with  regular updates at short intervals and the small collection of features i really need.Another plus point for me is the speed with which the computer starts up and shuts down again. This makes Xubuntu amazingly fast and so is only comparable to Artix Linux with the runit init.Well, and there is the look and feel - strictly speaking - no look and feel. Thus, Xubuntu is really only an offer for users who always customize the desktop according to their own taste anyway, or who don't care about the appearance. I guess they could get much more users, if they would spend much more time on a good looking look and feel - there is still a lot possible.Some points I deduct because of Snap and forcing Firefox to be Snap."

But in the end the problems largely outweigh the advantages, to name a few:- Snap support for Firefox is not only bothersome but broken when it comes to sound output- Qt and Xfce seem to have a somewhat difficult relationship, resulting in constant LMMS appimage crashes.- The same goes for xfwm and wine.- Lots and lots of unresolved dependencies and broken packages in the repositories that synaptic fails to resolve. I did not even know that it is possible to run into unresolved dependencies in the native distro reps. Why do they refer packages if they rely on others that are outdated or plainly missing?- random behaviour of the session manager, asking for a login password despite autologin one out of three starts.Thus I am calling it quits."

In particular, the Software Catalog was laggy and unusable. Inexplicably, I lost audio after two days. Not to be deterred, I researched the problems, and found several concurrent recommendations to instead try Xubuntu 20.04.5 LTS, and to decline any upgrades. Ah, what an improvement, this is what I imagined Xubuntu would be like.  First thing I did was get rid of Snaps, before I installed any apps. I checked the Software Catalog, it was simpler, and pleasantly functional. Xubuntu runs a standard Xfce desktop, so Xubuntu was easy to configure to my liking.  I had an issue with Restart. The computer would shut down, and start from off normally, but a Restart would hang during boot on a blinking cursor. Fortunately, I recognized this blinking cursor on my machine, a Core 2 Duo, so I appended the boot command line with EDD=off, then the problem went away. After that I loaded up the applications and turned this installation into a tool kit. A loaded Xubuntu booted 12 seconds faster than similar Linux Mint 21.1 Xfce. I recently needed to move data off my Android phone, so I tested my 10 Linux test distros to see which could do the task. Xubuntu performed this task better than all others, in fact, the task would have failed had I not used Xubuntu. I respect that Claude LeFebvre has declined to continue support for Snaps packaging for Linux Mint. I feel the same way. If Canonical insists on continuing that single-minded line of development, I will not be coming along for the ride.

Restarting the session to restore the panel is annoying, but when the panel disappears completely and a hard restart is required, this becomes dangerous and is unacceptable. In addition, Snaps deserve all the criticism they get. If I'm trying to get work done, I regularly get confronted with a desktop notification that a new Firefox Snap has just been installed and if I don't restart Firefox, I'm likely to experience problems.

It seems to be pretty light on resource use and it's easy to navigate. I liked the software/app store, and I added Snap and Snap Store to chase down a few applications. I also was able to install some deb pkgs very easily by using the built-in software install program. I am very happy that I am easily able to install and run Devede NG program, as I have found going back to DVDs very useful for teaching, since it's a robust technology in the classrooms (so long as there are BD or DVD players that work). I have to shift back to the classroom from all that online teaching, and this is a great way to transition a lot of the content and save it too. It's easier to carry a few DVDs to class than an entire laptop with all the necessary cables. I think this would make a great distro to put on those Win 10 computers that can't upgrade to Win 11. I tried Win 11 for a bit on two newer computers but decided that it stunk and just wiped it. Instead, Ubuntu is on the new mini-PC and Xubuntu is on the new laptop. A light install didn't install the software store on another computer, so I had to add that. I think the better way to do it would be to do a full install, and then just use the software store and install program to uninstall the stuff you don't need (if you need to save drive space). For me, that would mean uninstalling some game apps. Opinions and experiences vary, but of all the Ubuntu distros--Ubuntu, Ubuntu Mate, Lubuntu, Kubuntu, and Xubuntu--I would probably recommend Xubuntu the most even though I like all of them.

"
2623,2022-06-16, Xubuntu, 22.04,10,6,"This is my usual go to 'buntu.  It is small, light on resources and you can then install anything else you like.  One problem I have heard people express with Ubuntu (the main ""Buntu"") is that Gnome is something of a pain.  I get that.  On older hardware KDE and Gnome are just non-functional because they are too much like Windows in the resource hog category.  Xubuntu and Lubuntu aid with that.  I will also note here that on older computers like my Gateway FX (Intel Quad Core processor) even Mate chokes a bit and has problems.  Not sure if that is the older nvidia card or the processor, but Mate, Gnome and KDE are horrible on that system.  Xfce, IceWM, JWM, Cinnamon (weird that Cinnamon runs, but not Mate or Gnome) and TDE (basically KDE 3.5) all run beautifully on it.The great thing about this flavor of the 'buntus is that Xfce works and you can then install Cinnamon as a second desktop and it works too.  You can also go to the Cinnamon Remix of Ubuntu, but the advantage of installing Xubuntu as the base is that you get a solid, low resource running GUI that will work on most computers.  Starting out with Cinnamon or other more resource heavy GUI may result in a non-bootable or non-usable system on that old computer.  With Xubuntu, if you install a heavier GUI, you have Xfce as the fallback so you can still use the system.  Also, the 'buntus are generally a good set of distros.  I have come to prefer the LTS releases, however.  As expected, 22.04 seems to work reasonably well.  I had an issue on a Dell laptop with it working with my larger monitor that was attached via HDMI port, but I was able to find a way to fix that through the command line.  One thing about the 'buntus that is hard to find elsewhere is the community support.  Debian, 'buntus and Arch are three communities that are good to work with, but the 'buntu community is second to none.  Let's face it...Linux is pretty much similar across the board.  If you know what you are doing, you can get Slackware to do everything Debian, Fedora, a 'buntu or any other does.  The place where Xubuntu and the rest of the 'buntu line shines in support for those that are new or have only limited experience.  After installing 22.04 on my laptop and having the monitor problem, I had only to go to the community and ask questions.  The 'buntu community came to my aid with no muss, no fuss and no berating, insults or venom (some other distro's communities give a lot of attitude to people having questions).  I had the problem fixed in a day (most of that was just waiting on a response).  The solution was given in a step by step manner and the directions were easy.  Why spend time on this point?  Simple.  An integral necessity for any OS is tech support.  One thing the 'buntus have going for them is a community that provides that tech support for free and with a real sense of kindness toward newbies.I recommend using Xubuntu as the base for any 'buntu based system and then installing an alternate GUI (if you want one), if you are on a computer that is 5 years old or older.  For the most part, though, Xfce is everything most people need in a GUI.  Granted there are more polished Xfce distros out there, but most lack in the community support."

All of them run perfectly fine but a tad slow because in fact they are developed for today's hardware not that of a decade ago. Thought I would try a Xfce desktop Linux to see if performance improved. Actually I do notice the desktop performance improving but apps like Firefox actually are slower at least when I can perform some tests. Then you have the trouble of browsers hit or miss on hardware acceleration and I feel like things go south from there. Not saying Linux desktops are all terrible. But in the end only the desktop environments really have any bearing on performance. I will say so far the hardware in this notebook seems very friendly to all Linux distro's I have tried. But is there a Goldilocks distro that really works well, isn't buggy, has long term support and still tweaks older hardware?

Started with Redhat 5.0 and Corel Linux.(Dependency Hell, but a fortunate simplicity, and reliability nevertheless)Downloaded 20.04 from Australian mirror today - AARNET. Installation went ok apart from confusion over correct mount point syntax, not explained with a tool-tip in the installer. Hints would be nice.Similar experience to review before me. Looks great after boot, everything working fine.Installed updates from closer official mirror here in NZ, in terms of hops, and after patches are applied (not a full upgrade), I'm greeted with a permanent hard lock in XFCE I cannot get out of, which seems to be a blank screensaver with a working mouse pointer. Control-Alt-Backspace won't drop to system shell, despite being enabled at install. Cannot turn off without forced hardware powerdown - bios override by holding power key for 5 seconds.Utterly hopeless, and I've had far better stability with Q4OS, Devuan, and for that matter Puppy FatDog-64. If you're looking for a 'lite' distro, I'd recommend those apart from Fatdog 64, which is fast but lacks easy updates. Those 2 recommendations, do require some tweaking though out of the box. For example Q4OS won't preview thumbnails of image files without installing a plugin for KDE derived TDE window manager. However Q4 boots much faster than Xubuntu, and does not lock after normal updates. Devuan is bearable if you can tolerate Openbox window manager, which is not my cup of tea. Best of luck !"

My biggest criticism is that - out of the box - it looks somewhat dated, and there are minor annoyances such as the menu not being mapped to the super key by default. Easily rectified, though. I'd also suggest adding Slick Greeter (for login screen), Plank Dock, the appmenu applet (global menu), SkippyXD (for window expose), and changing the theme to Materia & icons to Papirus.

SparkyLinux is something different, somewhat 'leftfield'.It's not actually necessary to install SparkyLinux directly, You can simply add their repository (& keyring) to a vanilla Debian, and build from there, to get all of the benefits.This way works for me, because the SparkyLinux repository includes non-standard releases, e.g. SparkyLinux Openbox version that is not available for direct download. You can even get CDE, if you want to go retro!The SparkyLinux repository also includes applications that would otherwise have to be installed via potentially insecure external downloads.For example, I needed Microsoft Teams for a job interview. There was no installable application available from the Teams website, but there is from the SparkyLinux repository.I did the interview, and I got the job. Thank you Pavroo (the SparkyLinux developer).There're also useful applications such as Ventoy multiboot USB utility, and Brave browser, and probably many others, directly available from the secure SparkyLinux repository.PROS:Pavroo is incredibly dedicated. He also runs ArchiveOS, which is a library of discontinued and abandoned OSs.SparkyLinux is hot on the tail of the latest Debian release, so your system will always be up to date.CONS (not really):Be aware that the SparkyLinux repository includes the Unstable branch of Debian, so you may want to comment that out of your /etc/apt/sources.list.d, if you don't want your system to go slightly mad._I don't actually use SparkyLinux as a direct install, but the repository is invaluable. It's a perfect way to help build your own unique OS.Support this project, donate to it."

An used refurbished laptop(equiped with ssd and 8 to 16 GB RAM) of 2017 or 2018, does cost not more than 200-300 Dollars/Euro. In this machines Sparky just fly.Days before, I updated my Sparky 6 to 7 (stable one) and 7 to 8 -(rrolling version. No any problem during update/upgrade. Be sure to have enough space on your Linux partition when using it. 10/10 "

I checked, the laptop met the requirements but when I came to install it, it said I didn't have enough memory. Just as odd was asking for the password to install and then needing it repeated three times before it was finally accepted. Probably the least pleasant experience I have had trying to install Linux. The only upside is the USB loaded with this OS actually worked pretty well, shame it didn't install.

That's a Calamares problem that is the same with every other Debian based distro I have tried recently.Running live, at first I didn't like the Vala 'launchpad'; but now I appreciate it as a kind of app launcher that would belong on a touchscreen or smartphone. It's great if you don't feel like scrolling the menu.This version really is minimal while being very complete as a basic standard system.I did not have to remove anything before adding the applications that I want.I even had to add my own 'user-dirs.dirs' file to .config!If you want a user-friendly system upon which to build, then SparkyLinux Minimal GUI is a way to go. This is a power-user's system, compiled by someone who obviously knows what they are doing.This is an excellent manifestation of Openbox. Nothing is in the way of the operator. The menus are clean & precise.Added to this is that the Sparky repository includes secure versions of software that would otherwise have to be downloaded from a potentially insecure website (e.g. WPS Office or XnView).My only negative is that 'apt-xapian-index' & 'software-properties-gtk' are not standard. They make Synaptic much easier to use.This is the best distro I have ever tried.Where most distros put their image to the forefront, Sparky puts the OS first.The GUI is the icing on an excellent cake.I recommend SparkyLinux.Sparky is getting a donation."

2667,2023-03-08, SparkyLinux, 2023.03,8,3,"Many thanks to the developers of SparkyLinux for the awesome job on the distro, and for doing the difficult work of pulling things together for the sake of a few thousand users or so who have encountered some frustration with the process of Debian reaching v12 near the latter's 30th anniversary. Everything is OK now, but I have to confess where I come from with this review.At first I tried it with MATE, not sure now if it was the active branch. Because I was so busy distro-hopping and felt I needed something not based on Arch, Debian nor Fedora, I had to take it away. Sometime later I settled for SparkyLinux v6.6 with KDE but based on ""Bullseye"". Meanwhile I ran into tedium with my other installation, Debian with XFCE: ""initramfs"" taking ages to build, doing it three or four times per upgrade to Linux kernel and whatnot, running ""winecfg"" after installing or upgrading Wine held up until ""wineserver"" timed out, forced to use AppImages instead of ""home"" packages to be able to use Firefox and more. About two weeks ago I tried to get the Debian ""DI-alpha"" ISO. Installation was successful but then it refused to start into desktop for a silly reason. So I hoped SparkyLinux could be much better than that, and I wanted KDE instead of XFCE. It *was* (the ""22.12"" ISO) until I asked it to system upgrade. Near the end of the update it failed trying to rebuild ""initramfs"" for the fourth or fifth time.  It took about 2-1/2 hours from starting Calamares, successful install, reboot, do some system settings changes and finally system upgrade attempt.Oh well let me talk about the system itself. In live mode to start Calamares must give the password. This is the only distro I've tried that does this and I've tried a good deal with this particular installation program. It's annoying, please change it. Why is there the menu, which looks somewhat unprofessional on the left-hand side of the desktop? Consider a ""Plasmoid"" or something like Plank which I don't like but is not ""sudden"". The ""Welcome"" menu looks slick but it's a bit disturbing that when it needs to ask for user input, that main menu disappears to show another dialog. It's a ""Yad"" limitation but some people would point it out meaning to talk bad about something. I like the KDE default theme for this distro, which I've set without stupid animations and confusing transparency but the logging/suspend/shutdown screens are too ""cycloptic"" for my taste. Much appreciated is disabling tap-to-click from touchpad for clumsy users like me. Also well done that the 32-bit repositories are enabled by default. However, after ""dpkg"" is upgraded it warns about a ""usr-merge"" or something like that, which ""could lead to broken or missing files"". This could be a concern. Sorry but I have to stick to the ""traditional"" packages which are ""apt"" at the terminal, and Synaptics seldom.Again, thank you to the creators for this late break of news in this update.by mnrv-ovrf-year-c"
2668,2023-02-22, SparkyLinux, 6.6,9,1,"Best debian based distro IMHO... For really really ""oooold"" machines, the choice of LXQT over XFCE for desktop makes it feel much more efficient and modern when compared to MX-Linux.A wide (wild!) range of software is available... It is very difficult to find ventoy, motionbox, qmplay2, avidemux all on the same distro; maybe sparky is the only distro that does that.I instantly felt something lacking with the default openbox window manager provided by sparky... the compositor! I tried some compositors with openbox and it was not much different. So then I moved on to discard openbox and tried out KWIN. KWIN takes a lot more work and I was not fully satisfied with the end result I could achieve.Accidentally I stumbled upon an old gem called ""metacity"" and it worked like a charm. It is absolutely straight forward to work with. Just install and it is ready to use with whatever default LXQT desktop configuration you have. If preferred, set window placement to 'always center' and add 'minimize' button to the application windows.The desktop now looks much more modern and works a lot better to my liking. Of-course there maybe features of openbox that are not available/configurable with metacity or KWIN; but I don't seem to have needed them ever anyway. Similarly, both metacity and KWIN come with a lot of functionality that will probably never be configurable for the LXQT desktop and again I hardly needed any of it ever.Two thumbs up for the sparky team! Keep up the good work!!If you have not already, request you to evaluate if the move from openbox to metacity/kwin makes sense."

Tinkered with many other distros along the years, hoping to find something that was ultra stable and without systemD. Unfortunately, none of them would remain on my desktop for more than 3 months till I chanced upon Q4OS which was ultra stable but unfortunately with systemD. The only other negative was that it kept crashing when I installed the proprietary nvidia drivers for my 9600GT  unfortunately with no desktop on next boot. Left it for a year, hoping to find a replacement. This is when I chanced upon Sparky Linux, which did not play ball 2 years ago. Had another go at it yesterday and got to say the Live environment intrigued me. Took up the courage to install it on a physical drive, and I am mighty pleased as of now. Have not installed nvidia drivers but got to say everything works just like Q4OS did. Will try nividia drivers after a week or so and shall report back to you. One and only serious flaw I could find is that try as I might, I was not able to install the OS onto the hard drive with the built-in calamares installer using BIOS/MBR method for my ancient amd DDR3 Phenom 960 equipped motherboard. Finally, installed Gparted onto the live environment and told it to partition the drive into ext4. After that, everything was a cakewalk and butter smooth when using the calamares installer. Yeah!

Stable Debian base and is also offered as a rolling release, therefore huge programme selection, current versions. Wine installation excellent, incuding automatic the Windows fonts.

I thought the 22.04 semi rolling may have problems, so kept the stable version just in case, but have had absolutely no issues and prefer the semi rolling for up to date packages.Sparky is a clean version of Debian which runs extremely fast.  It has a useful set of tools and developer packages software for newest releases (such as newest firefox and newest Falkon). You can choose how often updates are applied, from hourly upwards. I'm using KDE Plasma on a Thinkpad and can thoroughly recommend."

Their repository has things that I only saw on AUR from Arch and so many things that I discover now packaged by its team, even themes and custom kernels.  Definetly, Sparky is a job well done with so much love.

For a long-term Linux nerd like myself, the semi-rolling minimal ISO is the best - it's basically a blank canvas where you can install what you want and polish it to perfection.Reasons to install this: - ISO sizes are modest. Other distros are getting too bloated.- Semi-Rolling gives you up to date packages with the stability Debian is renowned for. Updates don't seem to mess things up!- The last time I installed pure Debian, it was a bit of a nightmare with lots of things not working but Sparky makes the whole process painless. - Huge range of packages courtesy of Debian, plus a dedicated Sparky repo with lots of valuable extras such as Ungoogled Chromium  & multimedia packages which are missing from the main repo. - The principal developer seems to be a good guy who's passionate about the project (I'm impressed by how responsive he is to comments/queries on the Facebook group).

It is a fast and reliable lightweight distribution.

It works great and has made it usable again after just sitting around for a long time and better than it ever was with Windows. I tried other distros and this works the best with this computer. I also use Brave browser with helps speed things up on this old computer by blocking ads.

It also comes with a few ""click and close"" handy tools to remove broken deb packages, cleaning up cache, etc.But the main gem of Sparky Linux is the Sparky Backup System which creates a Calamares based installation ISO. It also lets you copy your personal settings and apps to /etc/skel folder, which then becomes the default ""package"" for the new users, once you install from the Live ISO.Personally, I use Redo Rescue to create intermediate snapshots, then restore the ""golden"" image on the target PC and change the hostname to distinguish the PC's on my home LAN.Overall, highly customiseable, robust and super-fast Debian Bullseye distro with familiar XFCE set of settings and utilities.  Highly recommended!

Similar to FreeBSD but a lot slower.Offers automatic setup of a desktop environment on first boot.If you choose to do so a lengthy install follows where the console is spammed with ""XXX Rated"" so you don't have time to read what is actually happening. When it's finished you can log into an Xfce environment.Xorg in MidnightBSD doesn't work properly in Virtualbox for me. The cursor is only movable within a limited area och it doesn't match where you are actually pointing.Tested version is 2.2.6.The project logo is nice at least.1 point for being BSD and 1 point for easy installation of Xorg."

This Midnight thing is even more immature as a project and not worth the time and effort of any but diehard bog reporters and other BSD enthusiasts with more than an inkling of hope for BSD in general.FreeBSD is a better bet as the documentation is amazing and a dedicated user can actually build a great BSD working computer OS.  Not so with this MidnightBSD mess, unfortunately.  I noticed that the main tech reviewers of MidnightBSD say openly that they ""don't want to disrespect the developer"" by saying how thin, unusable it is.. well.. sometimes that would be helpful as it might get them going on actually finishing the project.

2712,2023-07-07, wattOS, R12,9,3,"
I'm using this since a few months on my very low spec Asus X205TA (Atom Z3735G, 2 GiB RAM [not expandable], 32 GiB eMMC [not expandable]) and it really does what it says on the tin. Sure, given the very low RAM (and the slow eMMC) this PC has, I had to setup zswap, but the PC turns on and it's ready in a few seconds, then everything works very well.The only complain I have is that installation fails on EFI32 hardware (yes, this PC has a 64bit 4-core processor but a 32bit EFI...) so you have to fix the bootloader yourself, which is not that much fun if you don't have experience.Good alternatives to wattOs are Bodhi and LXLE. I had tried all three of them and chose the first as my favorite anyway."
2713,2023-06-22, wattOS, R12,8,3,"Fast, very fast.  Has a very clean, fresh looking intuitive desktop.  Running as Live CD at idle with wifi connected it came in at about 360MB.   It is a very fast distro running circles around MX on the same hardware 16 year old hardware.   I tested this as an alternative to the untrustworthy (in my judgement antiX).   It is not quite as light at idle but it appears to load browsers etc faster.   Also the desktop is more intuitive.  In some respects this desktop reminds me of Q4OS in terms or practicality and ease of use.  One negative is the lack of available docs,it seems they want you to sign up for a forum in order to even view documentation - what the kittens?   This is a desktop that will make old Window users immediately at home.   If you are running old hardware you owe it to yourself to test WattOS along with SliTaz, Q4OS, Bodhi, FossaPup, LXLE, Porteus and BionicPup.tfb"
2714,2023-04-04, wattOS, R12,5,3,"I installed this on an Dell Latitude E-6500. The install was easy enough and it does run with a very light ""footprint"" However there are some issues. There is no Date and Time adjustment, NTP function, driver manager or print support installed by default. These can be installed after the OS install, but you'd expect these basic functions to be installed by default. Flatpak applications do not integrate with the system menu, even when installed through the Gnome software manager. I couldn't recommend this Distro for a novice.  Watt OS R-12 is still a ""work in progress""."
2715,2023-03-25, wattOS, R12,9,5,"...I give it a 9 but should be a 10...It is LXDE and one of the LAST of a dying linux breed of ""flavors"".  I'm a SENIOR and have been using LINUX since LINDOWS - and prefer openbox simplicity and clean looks, its highly configurable! I realize WattOs is made for lightweight, but a package update notifier is lacking - it is available in SYNAPTIC though! As to printer hookup, well, printers are using driverless printing today and CUPS is changing things...wirelessly, etc. Debian #11 should last a while for now...  Works on my Lenovo thinkpad T540P and plan to install on several seniors towers as their primary OS in the NEAR future. Most are older models of i3-i5 chipsets with stock memory.  Other than that, for the average surfer and user - WattOS is a WAVE above for me! Much appreciative this OS has been REVITALIZED to todays LINUX standards of ""CHOICE""..."
2716,2023-02-18, wattOS, R12,9,1,"I run an older laptop, so am always looking at light distros that don't tax the system too much, and wattOS seem to fit the bill quite nicely.I appreciate as well that the default selection of apps is small, as otherwise I tend to spend a great deal of time uninstalling apps that I don't need (since boomer me is not a working power user, that means that many of the apps you might find necessary are just landfill for me). But since we are using the massive Debian repos, and Synaptic is installed, everything that you might need should be there at your fingertips. You don't even have to drop to CLI to get it done.In my trials I didn't push the envelope much, but did use it to test out some items that I had heard interesting things about (like the Brave and Min browsers). In my runs in installing various the things that I tend to use, Synaptic would occasionally throw up a caution/error message where something failed to run due to incorrect permissions and rights, yet everything seemed to install and run none-the-less. Therefore I didn't delve into any possible issues there.So overall, I found R12 to be a quite capable desktop experience that didn't throw me any curves or lead me into any dead ends. On that I can recommend it to folks. Really, the only thing keeping me from hitting a 10 on the meter is the init software, and I know that sort of outs me as an outlier. But to the average user with average needs, this distro is solid and capable."
2717,2023-01-12, wattOS, R12,8,4,"I keep an eye on distros aiming to low power and memory consumption and I can say straight away that WattOS has been up to the task.Very minimal memory footprint at startup 480mb~. Very responsive desktop. Stays under 2GB memory usage even under heavier loads.The general feeling I got is that of an improved / more polished version of the standard Debian LXDE desktop without the bloat.Preinstalled software is very limited indeed but this makes sense. WattOS installation media is one of the smallest in Linux World at ~1.2GB.Yet the small ISO size must have been the reason why WattOS installer did not complete installation offline. It is understandable to require active network connection but users should have been at least warned ahead of starting the installation. Mabox for instance warned me that I must be online to install it.Default dark theme is pleasant but I prefer light themes for increased legibility. ""Customize feel n look"" app made the switch to Adwaita theme / icons a matter of seconds. Desktop now looked more traditional / old-fashioned but easier to work with.The only somewhat serious problem I had was with flatpaks. I keep receiving the message ""'/var/lib/flatpak/exports/share''/home/myusername/.local/share/flatpak/exports/share' are not in the search path set by the XDG_DATA_DIRS environment variable, so applications installed by Flatpak may not appear on your desktop until the session is restarted."" Reboot unlike in other DEs does not solve this problem. I tried a few workarounds. No luck. Only way to create menu entries for the one or two essential flatpaks I have to use was by creating symbolic links to /usr/share/applications or creating custom menu entries. Not biggie in my books. Still an inconvenience.If you're familiar with Debian n debian distros, you'll find WattOS pleasant and a good base on which to build a lightweight system tailored to your needs."
2718,2022-12-01, wattOS, R12,10,3,"Awesome discovery!I had never heard of wattOS, until Distrowatch announced the appearance of R12 two weeks ago. Downloaded, put on a Ventoy stick, smooth installation (important for me: Calamares allows the use of a pre-formatted partition with my choice of UUID & label, my choice if and where to install grub), booted just fine with ~ 350 MB memory usage after opening the terminal.The preinstalled software bundle seems spartan to me, after all the ISO has 1.2 GB. I'm okay with that, easy to `apt install` just my preferred apps. After that, e.g. abiword & gnumeric instead of libreoffice, the disk usage is merely 4.7 GB. Very snappy, excellent performance, look & feel perfect for me!For the last years LXLE has been one of my favourites, but this one is better - considering that the former came up with a 'new' release based on Ubuntu 20.04 this summer and eats more resources. As a fan of LTS releases I'm happy with the Debian 11 base.Cons? No tool for printer setup - however after installing cups that's a piece of cake. I haven't found out yet why the repos are locked often, apt telling me that I have to wait xx hours until they are available to the public again. This behaviour is new to me.For an average user with average Linux skills no reason for a score deduction."

I installed this os yesterday and I'm really impressed cause i was using the antix os for a year now. The average temperature of CPU is between 43-45C which is absolute magnificent. If you have a 11 years old laptop like i do,the first thing you check is the average temperature cause a lot of linux distros make your pc overheating due to the lack of fitting well with the intel/amd cards etc.Also in Watt os the ram consuming is extremely low. Its 330-340 in idle situation and cpu consuming is zero to noneThe LXDE desktop is very steady compared to antix icewm manager which makes the screen blinking alotThe Watt os guys really did a nice work to put everything in the right place cause another thing i noticed is that firefox esr behaves alot better than of firefox esr in antix os. The scrolling is much better when youre browsing and the loading times in every website are extremely fast,considering the fact that firefox esr is not the fastest browser out there. Probably this happens cause Watt os guys chose to put in os the applications an average user should need and not a crazy large amount of applications which serve nothingAlthought i expected the claws email out of the box and mpv instead of vlc it didnt bother me cause i installed them later along with libre writer. Firefox ESR+claws+mpv(or vlc)+audacious+libre office is all the apps you need and you can have them in this distro so no big dealAs of the printer install and settings its very easy due to synaptics package manager to get the HPLIP toolbox and whatever you need from installations to updates the synaptics package manager is a reliable sourceYeah i think I'm alot excited about the Watt distro and i hope for everyone to give it a try especially if you own an old laptop/notebook cause honestly is worth it.PROS Very fast and light on resourses just what the watt os guys sayBest tuning i've ever seen between the applications and system which makes the distro user-friendly with everyday taskCalamares installation is ridiculous easy,not a problem at all. Boot loading time is ok,everything works fineYou dont have to be an advanced linux user for the Watt os. Very easy-handling CONSThe Watt os forum has to be expanded. I understand that there was an absence for a couple of years but i hope the watt community to get back and get growing with many new users like me alsoThe touchpad settings. Watt os has only configurations for keyboard and mouse so you have to add some parameters in home/config file to get your touchpad back in lifeThe absence of redshift-like application. In my opinion every distro should have a color temperature-tuning application out of the box cause people spend a lot of time infront of a screen

2722,2023-06-24, Oracle Linux, 9.1,9,3,"
Okay, Oracle 9.2 is a BIG download, but absolutely worth doing. Distrowatch does not provide selection for 9.2 yet.Thing is, after install I kept working on Wayland with the Noveau driver for Nvidia. Works perfectly on my desktop.My advice is to wait a 30 seconds after the boot of Gnome for great performance and speed.Question of software in the repos, all you need is there, but it is not Fedora. In comparison with Fedora, Oracle is minimalistic, but you can get all what is needed for the desktop.For software I installed flatpak as if Oracle is Red Hat. Works great.Why I do not give a 10 is I left for 2 weeks, and by return I expected at least 1 update.There were no updates.This is, together with Rocky Linux, the absolute best gnome distro I ever used. Did however not use Debian 12 or OpenSuSE 15.5 yet.So if you search a great rock stable workhorse and you want it devellopped by a firm, go for Oracle. You prefer Community or other desktop, go for Rocky. Have fun.I want to make very clear I use Oracle on my home desktop. I am a Linux user since Corel Linux and used almost all major distros including Slackware, Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu, Opensuse..."
2723,2023-05-27, Oracle Linux, 9.1,3,0,"Installer sucks bad. Freezes and has other issues.If you can't get past the installer part reliably why would you trust this to run your server?Inconsistent release cycles. 6 releases in 12 years? Come on...no thanks.It just feels like a very unstable and outdated RHEL clone that has nothing special to offer. Whatever this distro can do RHEL does it better. Since this is supposed to be a server distro there is literally zero reason to pick this over RHEL. None whatsoever.On and their logo looks silly...No sir, I didn't like it."
2724,2023-01-30, Oracle Linux, 9.1,10,13,"This is an enterprise class distro you may safely rely on. Basically, OL now serves the niche where CentOS used to sit backed up by the tech giant Oracle the same way as CentOS was backed up by Red Hat. It also has nice additions such as UEK and paid Oracle support for those who need it.While probably unpopular, my opinion is that Oracle behind this RHEL incarnation makes this distro a much more preferable choice in the long run as compared to those distros trying to replace CentOS (Rocky, Alma, etc.). Their credibility and commitment including the ability to sustainably finance their goals are doubtful to me. I don't see any reason why free OL is inferior to those initiatives while I welcome the community efforts. Oracle for many years follows its commitment to provide lifetime free unlimited access to the OL distro and repositories.Functionally, with OL you get the same RHEL as the RHEL itself, so there is no difference substantially."
2725,2022-07-12, Oracle Linux, 9.0,9,9,"Great! I was testing it on a spare computer tower I had that I thought was pretty much ""dead."" I thought that Oracle was a reputable company and they do so much for the Unix/Linux world (including contributions to the Linux kernel,) I thought why not give this old computer one last try? I installed it and it worked! I couldn't believe it! It was like a miracle! Some flatpaks don't work, but I think it's because it's an old computer. I seemed to always get an error message using ones that did work but worked ok. VLC worked ok when I tested it. I use to not be so much of a fan of their install prompts (""Fedora style"" -- unless they've changed it recently), but I felt this time was easier to use. I thought it was pretty reasonable. Only slightly more difficult than the Linux Mint/Ubuntu type install. Oracle install still helps you if you run into problems. The first time I experimented with a live USB,  I thought it was weird when I clicked on ""help"" at the top of the screen... I couldn't get back out of it to the main install prompts. That was a small problem that I would dismiss.I gave it 9 because I don't like the Gnome desktop.  With install you can have a user or choose not to. It was a bit fiddly to setup and when typing in terminal and having to do some things in root. So you may have to go to settings to fix it up. The ISO was also a bit large, I downloaded the ""full install"" version and maybe could have downloaded more minimal versions. But maybe I was suppose to download the biggest one to bring back my old computer to life? Uses Wayland which I think it's a step forwards as what computer enthusiast tell me. I played videos, music file fine. I thought I had set the timezone correctly when there was something wrong with ""certificates"" in the browser. Make sure you choose the right time zone!On startup,  it still shows Linux Mint as a distro that I had previously had trouble running without fiddling with the boot menu each time (on my main computer it works fine – it’s a great distro no doubt.) It has a choice of kernels that are unbreakable and some not. You have 4 seconds to choose and you stop the countdown by pressing up or down with the arrow keys. It seemed to stabalize more on a second reboot, but not everyone will experience this.Oracle is new to me but I’ll definitely consider using it in the future on my old machine. I heard about what happened to CentOS and all I can say is give Oracle a try! Even if it’s a big corporation! Only thing I have not tested yet is printing. You’ll have to see other reviews for that. Internet works for wired and wireless no problems. I found it interesting they use their own packages for software like Firefox. My main concern now is if Flatpaks works well on modern computers with Oracle Linux? More and more companies like Telegram only offer downloads in Flatpaks and Snaps and we know Ubuntu is pushing hard on Snaps.It’s a very modern, smart distro. At least consider it!"

Oracle Linux simply unlocked more power from my Ryzen 9. All benchmarks shows noticeable performance gains.The only thing that was hard to choke was the Oracle name.

But there is one thing that's really bad about this distro, and it's that Oracle removed a bunch of drivers from the ISO. One important one was the driver that was needed to read the virtual drives in my Dell Poweredge. Because of this, I did not install Oracle Linux on any of my servers. Oracle needs to put these essential drivers on the ISO, or else it's going to be losing A LOT of ground to those that do. Come on, Oracle!

A great distro for multimedia. It’s easy to use, easy to customize and looks nice. The stability has been hit and miss here though, which I fault at using the systemd malware init. I wish they would base the distro on Devuan instead because of init freedom and not being locked down proprietary style by systemd because of Debian.

It has to be burned on a DVD disk or it would not install. I also tried 1.02, 1.1.0 and 1.1.1 they also installed when burned to a disk. The last three though  did not have any file sharing at all.

2737,2023-08-04, MX Linux, 23,9,0,"
I'm reviewing this because I really appreciate the GNU/Linux kernel, Debian, and MX-Linux developers.I've been exploring variation of BSD-Unix and all the flavors of Linux I can find for over a decade and my two favorites are MX-Linux and Manjaro. There reasons for this are:1) I like things to just work, 2) I'm lazy, but 3) I like to tinker until it's personally perfect.MX-Linux -and more specifically, Debian- have a history of making very smart choices. I basically have faith they're not likely to break anything important. That's been my experience.The feature I'm most dependent upon in MX-Linux, and the reason I would never consider leaving them, is the Snapshot tool. When I've installed and removed software to my liking, I can take a snapshot of the system and create a Live-USB ISO for that system- with or without my userspace/personal files. I have several computers and I like them to work exactly the same as much as possible. MX-Linux's Snapshot tool has made my life so much easier that I'm spoiled to stay with it.I thought I'd break free from systemd when I switched to MX-Linux, but systemd it such as widely accepted disease that it has spread too much for me to easily avoid it.Most of my distro-hopping was a want to find a greener pastures with few bugs and steaming piles... I'm happy with XFCE on MX-Linux, but I don't know what I'll do with Gnome GTK gets any less sane in that most predictable future."
2738,2023-08-03, MX Linux, 23,9,0,"Been using MX since version 19, upgrading to 21 and now 23 as well. So far MX has been Rock Solid, except for one glitch in 21: a 2nd DE is not worth the trouble for my use case. In any case, MX stability is especially solid compared to Ubuntu-based distros I had installed in the past. But this probably is the case for all Debian-based distros as well, I use LMDE too in other machine.In-place upgrade in MX is on my wish list -Mint and Zorin have implemented this-, but so far upgrade has been smooth with /home partition in another drive.Installation is fast, no hiccup. However, MX ISOs (I tried 21 and 23) do not work if run from Ventoy. Direct write to spare USB drive is (currently) a necessity."
2739,2023-08-03, MX Linux, 23,10,0,"I have been using MX from version 19 and have installed latest versions after release.I found MX 23 even better than previous versions. It was very simple and very quick to install, it seems it took less than 5 minutes !OS is fast and responsive, better than 21 version.Unwanted software are very limited, has only commonly used applications and hence had to remove only few this time.Post installation I got OS setup to my needs and taste in less than 20 minutes.Since it is based on Debian and uses SysV init by default, and has soem very useful MX tools, it is suitable to even beginiers and also to experienced users (I have been using only Linux OS from last 17 years). It does not come in the way and allow users to just get the work done. Another benefits of being based on long term stable Debian base is comparativily lesser updates than Ubuntu based OS which goes through more frequent updates.It is stable, simple, responsive and user friendly."
2740,2023-08-02, MX Linux, 23,9,0,"I was very pleased with 21 and upgraded to 23 as soon as it was available in final form.Works well and fast, main reason to upgrade is to keep up with security fixes.The transfer of old information is facilitated by the mx-tools utility that can generate a list of user installed packages. That and some discipline in user data storage location makes upgrade fairly easy.Good experience all around, zero glitches.Also, most pupular packages that are not installed by default are available in the repositories, very quick to reinstall with no issues, just keep your customized config files around at need.I have tried many distros but this is one that I think will be my favorite for a long time.Regarding the need for reinstallation, this is very widespread now so we cannot realistically hold it against the distro. Pretty every distro is shortening or weakening long time support, so, fact there is little choice.I use the KDE flavor which is really, really nice. If it full featured but yet still runs fast and is very sharp. With the  default speed you get with MX, you do not need a lighter desktop to make do.I really recommend it.The forum content could be improved but that should come naturally given enough usage it should fill out like those of older popular distros.Laurent"

I have computers with all three Major OS at home, but find myself using the MX Linux laptop most often because it has the least amount of hassle allowing me to do what I want with minimum interruptions. It has allowed me to keep many an older computer longer than the Windows and even Mac OS worlds would let me by changing the OS to MX Linux and making it productive again without being overly complicated to do so."
2742,2023-08-01, MX Linux, 23,4,0,"I have been using MX since version 18. The reason I use it until this day is that once you've configured your desktop to your liking, it'll just work and remain rock solid. I haven't experienced any hiccup whatsoever. However, every time they release a major upgrade you're forced to reinstall. Some workarounds do exist, but it's cumbersome and not officially supported. This is such a bad user experience and I just dread having to spend half a day on making backups of files and configs etc. My old laptop is still on 18.3 for that reason, despite no update being released for that version anymore. It's just too much of a hassle and shouldn't be required. Other distros manage to deliver version upgrades, why not MX? I won't be updating my current PC (on MX21.3) to version 23.

Just put caps ""No Support, on your own as of Date X - Rather than hide your boo-boos. AND LEAVE MX special packages at the last compatible version. Something like this never happened in previous versions!Some of us are trapped by older version programs that get de-featured by newer offerings.I tried MX19.3 live, found the last compatible software versions in external repositories, tested then installed. Installation odd changes, but being a long time user I knew what I was looking for.All working just fine over the last four months, even on my weakest machine (Aspire One D255 with only 2GB RAM).. I even have a 6.1 kernel installed (2026 supported!!!!!) on the little netbook.On my machines I multi boot various operating systems, each has it's own partition ( primary or extended).TWO VERY IMPORTANT features of MXLinux that have been consistent over quite a few versions:1. Pinned in synaptic.  You can lock down a program, so it can't be accidentally upgraded. Sometimes this is necessary.2. Snapshots.You can create an ISO of your installation.  Either with home directory included or not.  All the programs, tweaks, preferences, customization's you made will be there. It is easy and painless to use.You can use this iso to install on other machines and skip reinventing the wheel.You could use it as a crawl back, if they break things as they did when MX18 was reaching EOL Wish I had done more regularly, and race to lock down the MX Package manager etc..While I have loved MXlinux for many years I am wary now.  Sure I can install hungrier and newer versions in additional partitions, but older versions are dedicated to specific tasks whether or not they are EOF and they should not be shredder-ed into hamburger. If you boo boo you roll back from your mistake, PUT CAPS you are now on you own after fixing, not tip toe away.  It's a bad precedent and potentially arrogant.To all MX19ers out there who have special needs or are not yet satisfied with MX21 or MX23, SNAPSHOT before June 2024. Just in case....Lifespans for Debian releases and Linux kernels seen to be decreasing, perhaps due to manpower issues or accelerating technological change .  This affects the MXLinux team as well, being #1 on Distrowatch has it's challenges., but does not excuse un-elegant retirement of EOL versions.My MXLinux future will be more cautious, careful and wary. There is much I like about this Distro and Debian in general. For the average user, to rehabilitate older machines, MXLinux is an Excellent choice."

It always ""just works"", and I've never had an issue I couldn't resolve fairly easily..this coming from a novice Linux user.MX23's updates are a treat..especially for me is Smb4k's new format. This makes it way easier to set up shares and is far more self explanatory with a friendlier GUI. Also a nice feature is that when in the terminal, asterisks show that you actually typed your password instead of dead air. Should also mention..no glitches at all with peripherals, printers or Bluetooth items..again, everything just works.All in all, after a clean install, and all back to my liking..very happy with the new MX23-RC1 rollout.

No, it's 5.27.5.  That's no big deal for me but users should know that being a Debian based disro this MX-23 KDE version will not update for a long time. Even though the desktop won't update quickly you can keep applications current using the MX test Repo and Flatpacks.  I've done this in the past and it's proved to be quite effective.

I suggest ventoy vers. >= 1.0.93 as multiboot-device-creator3) you can reinstall the original os/data everywhere directly from the booted clone (minstall command)4) this can be used as a fantastic simple backup system. A remote server wakes the mx-desktop-system up, let make an iso snapshot locally, copy (not move) to a remote server (Nas or so). Voilà, perfect and simpliest backup system."
2765,2023-07-06, MX Linux, 21.3,10,17,"You know when someone says ""they thought of everything"", well that's true of MX Linux. From the get go this distro makes it easy to do most basic things, from installing codecs, popular software, changing kernels, installing  a range of window managers and more using a range of GUI based tools that are woven into its start up screen. This approach thoughtfully takes a lot of the manual leg work out of setting up your laptop or desktop Linux environment, in a way that suits you. Better still, its very reliable being based on Debian stable and reasonably fast. I had it running with ease on 10+ year old hardware without a glitch. I would suggest you do an sudo apt update and sudo apt upgrade from konsole as soon as you get things installed. It makes using the GUI toos which come with MX, so much easier. Are there any downsides? As a minimalist, I tend to use Arch a lot as I can build bare bones based on my needs. I would like to see this offered in MX too, as opposed to the standard software load out. I do use some of the software that comes as standard with MX but not on all of my laptops. Being able to choose and configure what is installed from a bare bones starting point, would be great.All in all a really outstanding distribution that's accessible to newcomers and experienced users, alike. Ideal for a range of hardware. probably moroso established hardware, than cutting edge hardware perhaps but this is a rather minor distinction.  Great effort and hats off to the developers.  "

I'm using the XFCE desktop myself, my preferred view overall, and I really like how you can switch off the same background so you can have a different background on each workspace.   So very glad I dumped Windows for this distro, tried all the rest ( even some obscure ones :) )It's snappy, solid and unless you do silly things ( like PPA's from Ubun2 ) stable as a rock :)"

Everything is very easy to install and configure. I used to use Linux Mint Cinnamon and LMDE, sometimes there were problems, especially with LMDE with installing deb packages, sometimes the system just hung up.  With the transition to MX21 XFCE (MX 23-beta version) I was very pleased with the stability and reliability of the system, I have been using MX21 for more than a year. Thanks to the developers."

2770,2023-06-24, MX Linux, 21.3,10,8,"It's a great distro: easy to install and configure, availability of live usb maker and several desktop environments, etc.  Some programs were giving me problems without systemd, so I figured I'd boot Debian's latest Bookworm on a usb.  After spending over 8 hours to fix several issues with sudo, ufw, etc., and to get Bookworm to efi boot on my old Mac, I gave up.  I then  tried MX's program for cloning the live usb running system.  All I can say is that it's fabulous!  It completed without a hitch and I was back booting the Mac with systemd, by installing systemd-sysv on the new live system.  Many thanks to the devs and the detailed instructions on their website."
2771,2023-06-18, MX Linux, 23-beta2,10,16,"Normally I don't download and install a beta version of any distro but I was more than a little intrigued with what the next MX KDE could be.  While I haven't run it on my machine all that long it hasn't disappointed me. For some time now I've been in search for the ""right"" KDE distro; one that's stable, attractive, feature rich, fast and, most importantly, current.  You would think that wouldn't be all that difficult to find, but that's not the case.  Getting all five has been a challenge.  In my search I almost always rule out a Debian based KDE distro simply because KDE updates quite frequently and Debian doesn't.  Why then would I look at MX-23 beta2 KDE if there is an inherent weakness in it that I don't like?  Well, times change and so do I.  This distro is based on a very recent release of Debian (Debian 12 Bookworm), that it's using KDE Plasma 5.27.5 and that many of the applications have been updated.  Yes, soon enough it will no longer be current because the KDE desktop will update, but to my way of thinking how much better can KDE make their Plasma 5.27.5  desktop than it is now? What's left for the developers to improve in this version of Plasma?  It seems like now would be a great time to use it because when Plasma version 6 comes out the cycle starts all over and there will again be months and months of bug updates. This makes it a great time to try an MX KDE distro. In the short time I've used this beta version of MX-23 I really look and feel, so much so, in fact, that I will install it on my computer when it's finally released.  I can't speak to this distro's stability in all areas simply because I haven't used irt all that long, but for the time I have spent using it I have been quite pleased.  It looks like, in the near future, I will be dual-booting MX-23 KDE, MX-23 XFCE."
2772,2023-06-17, MX Linux, 23-beta2,9,3,"MX just keeps getting better, and now with Debian Bookworm it is even more solid. They keep on tuning and tweaking which just helps with the user experience. I am just waiting for the final, but even the beta has given me no problems(I may be lucky). I do have work ahead of me, I must upgrade all friends and family from 21 to 23 when 23 is ready. There are a lot of elderly people involved so they need something that just works, and MX does just that, and with Plasma it is quite intuitive. A while back we tried Arch based distros because of the rolling model, that was a disaster for the elderly, way to many breakdowns to keep up with."
2773,2023-06-17, MX Linux, 21.3,1,0,"Just a bad rendition of Debian.Reminds me of openSUSE with its bundled garbage apps to ""make things easier"". If you have to include your own distribution tools, then something is wrong.No LXQt desktop environment. XFCE is no longer lightweight and struggles with app theme consistency.At the end of the day it's Debian and suffers from Debian things.

I rate MX Linux 10 out of 10 compared to other Debian and RPM-based workstation distros.I've muddled through quite a bit operating and maintaining several Linux web servers over the past 20 years. I've been through most of them, Centos, Red Hat, and Ubuntu. The one distribution I have the least problems with has always been straight Debian. It's as stable as they come.It seems that between Microsoft, IBM, Apple and Canonical, the recent push into competitive advantage has broken a lot of stable technologies we use every day. All of my dedicated servers will now be Debian from here out. I'm feeling a bit worn out by all the shenanigans.Debian Bookworm is excellent. MX Linux 23 is even more impressive. MX Linux definitely my preferred presentation of a great operating system. It's made me really appreciate XFCE, too. There are a few quirks, like audio (Ubuntu always nails better than the rest); but, If you want less breakage or interruption of your daily tasks by updates, choose MX Linux. If you're using your Linux box professionally, you can't afford not to. There's some scary-looking code rolling out these days."

I tried MX and did not like it at all.  -This is my honest opinion and not intended to disparage MX linux in any regard, as I think the developers are hard working and honest in their attempt to provide a good product, but here are my reasons for my review:-Install not intuitive or simple.  I guess this is subjective but I just didn't like it or think it was simple.-Program was buggy and I encountered several very annoying problems after install.  Just should not happen.-Program did not feel responsive or solid.  I have been using Manjaro Cinnamon for several years and it actually runs rings around MX linux in almost every regard.  Side by side the differences are very noticeable.-Did not find the forum terribly helpful, especially in comparison to the forum at Manjaro.  Correcting issues was time consuming.-Long term reliability and performance was spotty at best.  Not a good thing for the #1 distro on distrowatch!-So my curiosity has been satisfied.  I am sticking with Manjaro, it has served me well as a reliable partner and tool--can't argue with success, speed, stability and performance.  "
2776,2023-05-28, MX Linux, 19.4,10,37,"The OS keeps out of the way and it has all the things one needs for day-to-day computing.I use Xfce.Nothing is missing as in many other distro's. For instance (and so important like always) producing a live-cd via an MX Snapshot ISO and bags of other usefull applications.It doesn't use too much memory, it is flashy fast and there are never problems with updates. Very, very stable. I use MX for years now. This after and/or aside nice PCLinuxOS, Mint, even Ubuntu-versions and more.A blessing it would be in my opinion when MX would be rolling. I hate new installs for the overhead of a lot of work after it.No complaint until now, so a 10 out of 10. "
2777,2023-05-18, MX Linux, 21.3,10,22,"I've been using MX for 3 months already.I switched from Mint which I found limiting as I left my novice stage. Now I feel MX is the perfect distro for me. There are a few reasons for that.Firstly - stability. Based on Debian Stable, which is the trademark of its own, the distro isn't prone to breakages at all. And it's got the huge package base, supplemented by software from MX repos, being often updated (incl. regular releases of Firefox, instead of ESR!).Secondly - flexibility. It shouldn't matter whether it's older or newer hardware - thanks to AHS repos, MX should work on both. Moreover, it offers a 32-bit ISO.Thirdly - ease to use. My DE of choice is Xfce, which doesn't get in the user's way and it's kinda intuitive. It's also low on resources and perfectly customisable.Fourthly - MX Tools. More geared towards advanced users, but designed in a way that a newbie can get along quite well. Especially ISO snapshots are a killer feature - the ability to have an own copy of OS on a USB stick, ready to be booted, is something I wondered how could I live without during my 10 months with Mint.Two small cons are an installer, which is a bit more technical than usual Calamares or Ubiquity and rather bland default theming, but that's not something you can't get used to.Overall, the distro ticks all of my boxes for a great Linux experience. You should definitely check it out, if you haven't by any means."
2778,2023-05-18, MX Linux, 21.3,9,12,"Still the king, and chugging along doing the work that needs to be done. KDE version is best and XFCE not far behind. Solid and faster than average with the best set of tools available in the Linux world. Choose between sysV and systemD, and enjoy whichever. Debian is the backbone and the software selection is great. If there is a shortcoming it could be said that the ISO could be slimmed down to be as fast as possible. I would love to have a bare-bones MX that I could build out. This is a minor issue, if an issue at all really. It can be counted on to be reliable."

Lenovo is not the most Linux-friendly hardware, so I had my troubles with different distros...but MX just worked out of the box.I only missed my favorite old-skool MATE desktop, so I recently installed it on MX. Now, MX and MATE do not play nice together, but I managed up till now to solve any problem that occurred. As a consequence MX, with MATE desktop, will remain on my Lenovo laptop until its shelf life runs out. So, in conclusion:Really nice distro, very intuitive desktop environment, no worries-no prob install and operations. The scope and number of apps and programs is somewhat overwhelming. Most users will not even need half of all the programs that come with MX. Rookie users will have to settle for the default desktop managers, but they all operate perfectly. But remember: MX is Linux, so every feature can be reconfigured and/or replaced.MX gives me peace, quiet and stability. Sometimes I just lean back in my chair and just stare at the system, and I praise myself lucky that I found such a brilliant OS.Super distro, cudoes to the developers!"

Some minor things(e.g. brightness changes with Fn in steps of 2 instead of 1) or was very easily resolved with the forum or the documentation. Easy to install apps as long as they are Debian packages.Not so easy - 3 different GUI preinstalled apps for installing & updating packages, but only synaptic has a easy accessible archive to resolve problems with updating, installing and removing apps. Orphaned packages not consistent over the package managers.Flat-package and App-image broke after some base system update and could be revived by manual reinstalling some dependencies. (the same packages worked without problems in Mint).Easy to adjust appearance and behavior of Xfce to my preferences.User experience and default parameters are for me a little less consistent as Mint Linux. That it's less polished and pleasing to eye was for me not relevant.After using it now about 3 month as primary system, it's a close race with mint xfce with open end for me."

2783,2023-05-08, MX Linux, 21.3,9,2,"MX Linux is a remarkable Linux distribution that offers a perfect blend of stability, performance, and user-friendliness. Based on Debian's ""Stable"" branch, it benefits from Debian's extensive software library while maintaining its own identity. The default Xfce desktop is fast, responsive, and intuitive, with a sleek and modern design that is easy on the eyes. However, for those who prefer alternative desktop environments, separate editions with KDE Plasma and Fluxbox are also available.One of the standout features of MX Linux is its simplicity and ease of use. The operating system is designed to be accessible to both novice and advanced users, with straightforward configuration and settings that are easy to navigate. Additionally, MX Linux is highly stable, making it an ideal choice for those who prioritize reliability. The medium-sized footprint also means that it runs well on older hardware, providing a great option for users who want to breathe new life into their aging machines.

2784,2023-05-08, MX Linux, 21.3,9,6,"The installer: it had some odd quirks. First: I couldn't under any circumstances change the layout of the partition order.... for example, let's say partition 1, p1 was boot, p2 was root, and p3 was home.... If it previously had been p1 boot p2 home and p3 root (because the format for the installer, using remaining space, etc. was the worst I've seen since salix. It's unintuitive and outdated.) So even when going to an outside disk/partition manager, creating a new layout, creating the partitions maually, it refused to let me change the order. Even though I had created a new layout, it still saw p2 as root even after a reboot. I eventually decided to leave them and try it anyway using the up arrow to ""use the remainder of the disk"" (I shouldn't have to do that in 2023.) So, for this reason, the loss of 1 point. (Even if this issue is isolated to the AHS edition, the installer is still outdated).The Positives: The workaround for not having systemd is pid 1 works great, basically just keeping systemd installed and referencing it like any other library. The flatpack addition is a big plus, it had all the modern mesa / vulkan installed by default. It's already set up for testing and backport repos which all work great. The updater seems like a synaptic frontend with extra features. My steam games (proton), etc. worked flawlessly out of the box even with the stock MX kernel, I eventually installed Liquorix and the system has been running fantasic for months now. The AHS edition, is stable but with the added benefit of the newer firmware and graphic stacks, audio, cpu, etc. pulled in (I had been doing this on other distros (namely Devuan) for a few years now. So the fact that I now have more free time, makes this Distro a huge plus!Others: Going on almost 3 months now, the laptop has had only one issue, the default kernel would perpetually start the laptop with screen brightness almost off, was having to brighten it on each boot. I installed the Liquorix kernel (which is in the repo) and this issue was immediatly fixed.Final thoughts: I can easily recommend this distro to anyone for any purpose, I can't belive it took me so long to try it. As a previous reviewer had mentioned, the installer has some quirks, if you're trying to dual-boot, it's always best to back things up first. If you're looking to scrap Windows all together (my recommendation) As a single-o/s computer this distro works great, fixes basically everything wrong with Debian's core policies."

It is a manual that in Italian is no less than 249 pages, fully translated that guide you through system preparation, installation and maintenance.Using this distro on a work computer I appreciate so much the stability ( it comes from Debian Stable and not Sid like Ubuntu) because it never crashes: of course the packages are less updated than on Arch, but if you really need it there is the test repository with much more updated packages and it is active flatpack with everything up to date.  During one installation grub got corrupted, but turned the pc back on with the installation stick and looked at the manual I ran MX Boot Repair which recognized both Windows and Linux installation. On reboot everything worked.This is not an S.O. for gaming, it is for those who need security at work!

The pieces are all there BUT only the base OS works. As of just this writing here's what works-Installer-base OS-Containers for Fedora/Ubuntu, etc-Updating OS (with caveats, immutability needs to be disabled as there's a bug currently).What doesn't:-System Update option should be available rather than updating through CLI. Better clarity in what is being updated (system or containers?). -Android stuff-Web Store-Immutablity (requires removing blend from mkinitcpio.conf for now to update)-I'm sure there's more I missed blendos github will have moreThe lack of BlendOS documentation and using Telegram as a support forum makes this not a good option for a community. Forums work as they create an archivable living document of issues and resolutions over time. While the Arch, Ubuntu and Fedora bits have lots of support, that helps somewhat but there needs to be some links on the main site to any issues that a user can resolve. BUT BlendOS is a BLEND of various OSes and thus needs some more specialized support. I think it requires lots more polish before I'd call it usable as a daily driver. BUT it's got REALLY solid potential as an OS. I'm definitely keeping an eye on it as it improves. That it uses KDE Plasma for me personally is a nice touch as I like KDE over Gnome, an nice plus would be to add more DEs or a tool that scripts installs for other installs. While I can fix most Linux problems on my own, it's nicer to have a ""just works"" OS (of which there are quite a few already). Again the 5 stars are because I feel like this OS came out WAYY too early before many of the features were properly baked, the lack of proper documentation and a lack of a forum. Discord and Telegram are great for chats and hot takes, not for proper support. Lots of good info plus repetitive questions which could be linked in a forum post instead (even if people still ask the same questions). A good Linux distro IMHO requires a solid but WIP distro that's at least potentially usable as a 1.0 daily driver (BlendOS is in 2.0) AND a solid community infrastructure for support which has been the success model for other more well known distros. The potential is here given the creator of the Distro, Rudra Saraswat has created a number of amazing tools for Ubuntu and even Ubuntu Unity. I truly look forward to seeing this distro progress to the point it's my daily driver. "

This used to be a good distro a while back, but it is not any longer. Resource usage has been through the roof, the use is systemd is a further step into proprietary, closed source territory, gnome is resource intensive and user unfriendly and being based on Debian still, it is no longer as straightforward and easy to use and requires a lot of research."

I love Debian (or Devuan) distros with Xfce so I tried this almost unknown distro (number 230 in DistroWatch list).The installer is a little bit cryptic for just a user like me, but in the end I was able to install it in my test laptop.Everything seemed OK so I updated the system with Synaptic.Suddenly anti-aliasing disappeared (appeared with a complete re-start). Later I realized that the internet connection icon in the panel didn't work, so I thought there was no connection, but connection worked. I downloaded several more addons for the panel but when I was installing them the panel disappeared. I tried to recover it with the settings panel button but there was only a cryptic message. I re-started the system but it didn't appeared. I reinstalled it with Synaptic, but it didn't work either. With no panel I abandoned Refracta.It is the worst Xfce Debian/Devuan derivative I know, and believe me: I know a lot.."

Refracta is very clean, but I cleaned it more. I made it as clean as possible. Then, I installed the applications I need. You know, I am a 'paranoid'. So, I decided to make a kind of 'Tails' or 'Heads' of my own. I am very satisfied.

Everything goes through Tor (Swordfish Browser), Encryption Wizard, VeraCrypt, Paranoia Text Encryption, encrypted Tutanota email app-image, and so on.

Based on CentOS, with some pretty decent additions, some paid.The main thing to watch is what they plan to do now that  IBM/RedHat has changed its model, and ClearOS must change from its current upstream provider. They have announced ""version 9"" and say it will be produced ""in-house"" but that was many months ago with no updates or details or ETA for a first look, let alone a release.In other words, think of it as a mature (for 2020), secure server that might be good for simple applications that will only be used for a month or two, but not for long-term use, at least not until they have a clear roadmap for when we see a preview of their next version, and what their plan is for the next five or ten years.I was hopeful for them. They have had some good people on staff and in their online community. But their current silence and lack of news or product updates suggest we use extreme caution with new installations, and give a high priority to plans for migrating to a different provider.

Have had no problems with security.I have one major grievance with Debian.Why so many methods of installing it?It seems three or four would be plenty.Linux works with a great deal of hard ware.You can not beat its security, speed or configurability.You will have to learn stuff.Comes with all kinds of languages to program in.Perl, Python, C, and a favorite BASH.Give Linux a try!!Thanks to all that support Linux!"

Version 12 is even better than the previous ones. The first thing you notice is the tremendous speed of start-up and shut-down. Debian 12 is lightning fast. Boot is hardly more than 3 seconds! I run all Debian systems on both XFS (for /) and Ext4 (/home; /boot).I have been using XFS for approx. 15 years with great results. It always does well. The Debian installer is one of the very best available in the computer world. Offers a lot of options. Graphical interface, installing in shell (without mouse), ""automatic"" vs. ""manual"", a selection of file systems [could actually also have the option of a UFS2 file system], and ""Expert mode"". It offers many more options than generally need to be used.This device has never failed in the many Debian installations I've done, over two decades. Started using Linux in the early 2000's and stuck with it ever since.Debian 12 automatically installs both WiFi firmware and CPU microcode. You can hardly think of a more convenient operating system, faster, more stable and more flexible than Debian.Works very well e.g. with KDE5 Plasma and Cinnamon. Have used both interfaces with great success.However, there are a few things to consider.Take a good look at font rendering, which is a simple matter. Consider installing ""rkhunter"" and ""chkrootkit"". Also on Thinkpad: tp_smapi, acpi-call-dkms,Privoxy proxy server (forward proxy server) and Nftables (firewall, good information online and easy to configure).It is also good idea to install Timeshift and take a system backup with it.This allows the entire system to be restored from scratch, IF something goes wrong (has never happened to me).How long can good get better?Thank you.

I opted for a clean install rather than upgrade from 11.7 because I had introduced some testing and unstable bits to 11.7. Everything in stable is serving me well though I have installed Firefox from unstable only because the ESR version gets stale too quickly for my taste. I like having the non-free repo by default. It's nice to have functional wifi and graphics from the start, though that never seemed too hard to resolve by obtaining the correct firmware bits. Debian takes a little fiddling as compared to some distros (Ubuntu-based distros, for example) but this creates an opportunity to learn something about what is actually happening. For those not inclined to fiddle with things from time to time, Debian might not be the right answer. For those who want a fairly straightforward and functional system without a lot of extra bells and whistles, I'd say give it a try."
2813,2023-07-15, Debian, 12,9,10,"If I'm rating it out of ten, then I must say that version 12 has been very solid for me so far. The inclusion of the non-free-firmware repo by default is nice, and the upgrade went smoothly on my server. On my desktop however, the upgrade didn't go very smoothly. I'll chalk this up to issues with Debian 11 though, since the issues I had upgrading were issues left over from my previous Debian 11 install.Debian 12 does work fine on my desktop when installed from scratch, however I've had issues for a while now with the ""wait, menu, wait, menu"" style installer rubs me the wrong way.To me, Debian 12 feels like an extension of Debian 11, but with ease-of-use optimizations. Adding the non-free-firmware repo is very nice, especially for someone with an Intel Wireless card in their PC. When the official distro adds better support for stuff like this, it makes it much more usable, since solutions to problems don't have to be so hacky, which leads to less problems.A heavy con of Debian in general, continued into 12 is the package manager. Apt is easy to use, so I have no issue with that, but my problem with Debian's handling of the package manager is its lack of good non-free support. Apps like VS Code, Docker, Tailscale, and Spotify (just to name a few) all have to separately be added to /etc/apt/sources.list.d, which makes them more annoying to keep up with, and they heavily slow down apt update. This could easily be fixed by including flatpak, although the Debian team doesn't seem to be too keen on this. Flatpak CAN be installed, but they make it more annoying than a distro like Fedora, or Arch. If Debian kept a better closed-source software repo, or better support than flatpak, I would find Debian much more useful as a desktop distro.Of course, on a server, none of this is really much of a problem, but it's still annoying nonetheless.Overall, even while not being too much different than Debian 11, I really think that Debian 12 is a step in the right direction, and makes me much more optimistic about Debian, and makes me feel much more likely to reconsider it as my main distro, although the poor closed source/flatpak support sours this."

Why?Reinstalling via net installer corrects previous issue but trying to install some common test softwares fail.  sudo apt-get update fails so does su, apt-get update.Not a fan of the default Gnome desktop environment either since it takes some getting used to.At this point thinking about the saying about avoiding .0 releases so decided to give 11.7 a try.  Hit another roadblock when it couldn't load WIFI drivers during install.  Apparently, they're not included with 11.7 DVD ISO or net installer like with 12.  After some digging found hidden 11.7 ISO with non-free drivers plus Cinnamon DE that successfully installs along with test software.Final verdict is if you're interested in Debian stick with 11.7 but use ISO with non-free drivers if your device is fairly recent within a few years.

2819,2023-07-10, Debian, 12,10,38,"Version 12 surpassed the main objections people used to have about Debian: outdated packages and poor out-of-the-box hardware support. By incorporating non-free drivers on the default installation media, this issue was successfully addressed, and more people will have all hardware recognized and operational right after the installation process, just like what happens in other so-known as ""well-polished"" distributions, like Ubuntu and Mint. In my particular case, network cards demanded non-free drivers, and everything was installed automatically during the installation process. I only had to install manually the drivers for Nvidia video cards, but it just took some simple steps, as I followed the official docs page about this topic.In general, the packages are not outdated as they used to be in the past Debian editions. Important packages like kernel, firmware, and desktop environments/applications are not so many versions behind other distributions like Ubuntu and Fedora. Since it focuses on being a very stable distribution, it's understandable that some time is required until packages are considered mature enough to be included in a release.Although I've migrated from bleeding-edge Fedora 37/38 on my personal computers, I didn't see any substantial issues related to older packages. As mentioned before, at this moment, the difference between Debian and other bleeding-edge distributions is very small. Some minor problems can be managed by using Flatpaks or Docker containers.Gnome 43.4 seems very polished and stable. The only drawback is the large amount of software installed by default installer, like many games, which would be better if it was left up to the user to install this kind of item manually later. I've spent at least ten minutes in Gnome Software to remove all the games that were installed by default. A minimal Gnome installation would be a better choice.After migrating from Fedora 37/38, I'm satisfied with Debian 12 as a daily operational system for software development and office tools. Because I'm using Linux professionally on my main computers, I don't want to spend time fixing things that eventually will break on a system update. I used Arch Linux for three years, and it's a great Linux distro to learn in-depth about how Linux works. But I don't want to discover that my audio card or webcam stopped working due to a system upgrade when I'm about to start an online meeting. For this reason, I keep a distance from rolling-release distributions and appreciate more stable and tested systems. Due to the rising popularity of technologies like containers and flatpaks, the gap between stables and ""unstables"" distributions has considerably decreased. You can have a stable core and use newer packages only when they are really necessary.Talking about servers, I'm migrating my dedicated servers and VPS from CentOS to Debian. The last RedHat decisions made me aware of the risks of using company-owned distributions. Since all the other viable options are maintained by companies, switching to Debian was a natural decision. Could someone point something as reliable and stable as Debian for the long run? A second choice could be FreeBSD, but many cloud providers don't provide this option.Red Hat announced the changes in the way they distribute RHEL code just some days after the release of Debian 12. Was it just a coincidence? Or are there some people at Red Hat trying to suggest to the community that Debian is the right choice to replace RHEL-based systems?We will never know the answer, but Debian surely can handle it well."
2820,2023-07-07, Debian, 12,10,21,"Ubuntu was the OS which brought me to Linux world. I almost always stuck to debian based distros, therefore I didn't like the approach of Fedora updating every 6 month. Now with RedHat (or IBM twisting RedHat's arm) is going full on anti-open sourceness, and Ubuntu shoving SNAP on us, Debian 12 is what saved me from the corporate dictatorship. It is a huge upgrade over Debian 11, which was based on quite older version of GNOME. The auto inclusion of non-free firmware by default is a blessing for us normal end users, who just want to use our PC without having to dig through dirt to find the driver for the hardware.

Forcing of non-free repos and drivers during the install needs to be changed... Linux is about choice and not being force fed something by default. Yes you can turn this stuff off AFTER the installation, but by then you would have already installed non-free packages and so you will be doing un-necessary work in order to get rid of all of that stuff should this matter to you as a user. It almost feels like someone went for ""easy"" instead of the traditional Debian approach. This kinda sucks to be honest...If this was some corporate product and developers were trying to make this more appealing and idiotproof for the consumer/customer I get it, but Debian is suppost to represent the opposite of this kind of approach....what's happening with Debian?"

It then crashed yet again installing certain software from the repository. All this in the space of about 40 minutes! Arrrgh!!!Screen scaling was bad off the cuff and I had to go into display and sort that out, too. Certainly a more minor issue but after the problems I have just had, it left a bad taste.I'll be frank, I think this release was premature. Its my view that further testing is needed to ensure stability and reasonable, if not perfect, optimization, for a range of users and equipment. As a final note, the install laptop has run LMDE and Neptune Debian 11 very well and in the case of the former, ran it for 2 years, with barely an issue. In closing still like Debian but will be sticking to previous releases, until this is hopefully sorted out."
2825,2023-06-25, Debian, 12,10,8,"Just blown away by this release! Had a funny 5 minutes getting Protonvpn-cli to work, but got there in the end. All the software works flawlessly and is not epically outdated this time. So smooth, with addition non-free software available at the tick of a box. Very happy, and FREE!!! So thanks Mint LMDE and Manjiro/Arch and Antrix, this current offering surpasses them all. I think my distro hopping has come to an end finally, it's about time (although I got rather good at clean installs!) Many thanks to the Debian team _/\_"
2826,2023-06-25, Debian, 12,10,65,I have given a score of 10 because this time with version 12 Debian has for me at least nailed it. Everything works out of the box (on Workstation HP/Dell machines certified for Linux). The software that i use is not outdated (Firefox ESR maybe old but that's the one that i use anyway). All the software i need is there in the repos or is supported on Debian (Virtualbox hasn't made it yet to the repo but should soon) and i found no annoyances. And above all Debian is not run by a corporation - was free and will remain free - this is perhaps the most important factor for me. Took me a decade experience to understand that Stallman was right.
2827,2023-06-24, Debian, 12,10,18,"Switched to linux in 2020. Have used arch, manjaro, xubuntu, puppy os, bodhi, fedora, cent os, etc. It was not too hard since I own 1 desktop and 6 laptops, plus a raspsberry pi. I've come to conclude that debian and puppy os are my favorites, and distros I plan to use for many years to come, perhaps even my whole life. Arch was my daily driver for over a year, and I've grown to despise it, I have retired it as my official ""gaming and emulating old games and ONLY FOR GAMING distro"", whilst debian is my daily driver for my many, many other computing needs. I tend to now recommend beginners skip ubuntu, and jump right to debian, of course, that is if they don't mind spending a couple hours with me helping them set it up on their PCs. If a beginner is going to install a distro all on their own and don't want to research online, ubuntu is still a decent choice, but I've heard every single friend who's tried ubuntu had it break eventually, including for me when I started out. I have never had a friend tell me their debian broke. Note I am also someone who does not care about the latest features, I really don't care if I am even behind by a couple years. If I need anything for my modern gaming needs, that is what my desktop PC with arch is for. I keep the two seperate for a reason. "
2828,2023-06-23, Debian, 12,9,0,"Installed from Debian 12 KDE live without a hitch . Almost everything working flawlessly. The feeling of great stability and reliability is unmatched, and if that's important to you, then it's a big deal. One fly in the ointment is Zoom, that won't load properly in Bookworm, although it works fine in Bullseye.  I love Debian, but also use MX Linux and Mint. Did a manual install with a boot/efi drive, a root partition, and /home.  The fat 32 efi partition held the boot flag and grub was installed onto the correct drive. Very convenient having the firmware as part of the install. Still helpful to go to /etc/apt/sources.list and add contrib and non-free to entries even though we now see a non-free firmware entry.Enjoy"
2829,2023-06-23, Debian, 12,10,1,"What to write? In short - this is it! Linux at its best. Simple, extremely stable, good old-fashioned but modern at the same time - that's Debian. For a long time I have been distrohopping, and I used to skip Debian - it was stable, but quite outdated, especially in design, and there were often problems with hardware support. That's over - Debian 12 combines modernity, simplicity and stability at the same time. Ubuntu never again! It may have a beautiful design, but it is going the way of Windows - huge size, Snap packages, the user is no longer the first priority - orientation towards servers and IoT. The only advantage of Ubuntu is the unparalleled hardware support, which for many will weigh in. Debian 12's inclusion of non-free repositories in the installation reduces this problem quite a bit. It makes up for its shortcomings with the extreme number of software packages available in the repositories (over 100,000), rock solid stability, and a focus on user-centricity and usability! Plus, support for 32 bit systems (admittedly the last time, but tell me, which Linux still offers this in its major versions?) and free and open source software. What more could you ask for? "
2830,2023-06-23, Debian, 12,9,1,"The GOAT of linux.The only I am not giving a 10/10 is the following: for programming getting up to date releases of programming languages can be a pain, as the ones included in standard repositories will lag behind a bit. There might also be a moderate learning curve for noobs. In regards to getting bleeding edge desktop applications, you should be using Flatpak anyways.By far the best overall Linux distribution in my opinion.If you want a more brain-dead solution however, I recommend Linux Mint for a general desktop computer, or Ubuntu for software development. They're less cohesive, slower and more resource-hungry, but they're more brain-dead easy for noobs."
2831,2023-06-23, Debian, 12,10,11,"Debian's installer is where it truly shines. Instead of relying on a generic setup, Debian allows for easy installation into a range of partition configurations. Skipping the installation of a desktop environment is a simple task, offering ultimate system control and customization to suit any user's preferences. The resulting operating system is minimalistic, to a comparable degree as Arch, but stable in comparison. Upgrades will be limited to security and bug fixes within the next year and a half. Furthermore, by installing Flatpak applications on top of a stable base, users can obtain regularly updated upstream apps.Personally, I enjoyed installing a bare bones Gnome session and all of my preferred free and open-source software (FOSS) user applications for Gnome from Flatpak. This created a semi-rolling system where the core system assets have been rigorously tested for stability and safety while the apps I utilize for work and leisure remain up-to-date.For those who have yet to explore Debian, this latest version serves as an excellent introduction."
2832,2023-06-23, Debian, 12,10,10,"I've always wanted to use Debian as in the past I tried PopOS, which was OK, and Sparky which I liked (I didn't have much luck with Arch derivatives; Manjaro broke, as did Artix and Endeavour OS). However, I found Debian 11 too difficult to install on my laptop due to firmware issues. Debian 12 works and the install on the live image is very easy. I like how there is no bloatware on Debian. Debian is what an OS should be: simple, small and stable. I also like how Debian is a community rather than a company. "
2833,2023-06-22, Debian, 12,10,6,"I am a veteran Linux user.Up to Debian version 10, I have never used Debian, only Ubuntu and other Debian based distributions. Since version 10, I decided to use Debian mostly on my VPS instances, and slowly after that on my desktop/laptop and local servers. I must say that version 12 is the best Debian I had the chance to use. Everything works flawlessly. I am using Debian 12 with GNOME on my main laptop, and another with KDE on a desktop. Both are great, but I tend to like GNOME better, as it has no flow and stays out of your way. However, KDE does offer some great apps that you don't have in GNOME. Nevertheless, Debian as the underlying system is rock solid. I have already installed it on my VPS and local servers too, to replace the old version 11. My advice is to try Debian 12 as your daily driver, and you will not regret. Chances are, you might start liking it so much that you will continue to use it over any other Linux distro out there. Throughout the time, I have used openSUSE (extensively until they started doing an awful job with the distro), Ubuntu (until they messed up too), Fedora (which I still love) and now Debian (which I find the best of them all). Thank you, Debian developers. Keep up the good work. "
2834,2023-06-20, Debian, 12,9,9,"I love the configuration options, rather than getting the OOTB experience, I choose exactly what I want and get what I want.  I'm currently using KDE plasma for the same reason and the manual expert install works perfectly on new and old hardware.I've done updates from older versions and usually do that but prefer a fresh install, since I run a daily cron job to backup my data to a second drive.  It's easy to add third party software that isn't included; for example I run Proton VPN, using the protonvpn-cli.  I also use Signal and Cloudflare WARP.Other distros may be easier to install on the latest harware but with backports it's easy to get later kernels and I haven't had any hardware isues is the last decade or more.Customization takes time, but the results are worthwhile.  I understand that not everyone wants to do that."
2835,2023-06-19, Debian, 12,10,15,"Firstly I have to say that I've always heard about Debian and how great it was, but also how it's not for beginners. This really is just the truth, Debian is an amazing independent distro that delivers stability and speed, though in the hands of an inexperienced user would be something frustrating and confusing.My distro hopping journey began in 2015 with Parsix (which was a terrible distro and it's not even being developed anymore) which lead me to Ubuntu, then Mint, and lastly MX linux (before settling on Debian 12). All of these distros were based off of Debian (Mint being based off of Ubuntu) and all of them were easy to install but ALWAYS had some problems later. My last distro before finally trying Debian 11 was MX and I have to say if it wasn't for the MX Linux community I wouldn't even be writing this review, they always praised Debian giving them a stable base for their OS which ultimately got me asking myself ""MX is great but... why don't I just use Debian for the ultimate stability?"". Then about a month and a half ago my MX 21.3 went through an update which knocked out my wireless card with some weird driver issue (something that should have never happened), and that was the final push for me to stop using distros based off of other distros. I was done using these easy to install now and a bunch of problems happening later distros..I was just so sick and tried of it all.. From there I tried Debain 11, my VERY FIRST independent distro. It wasn't easy to install but WOW it was so fast, so stable, and an amazing os. There is a lot of 'Do it yourself' things one needs to do when using Debain, but if you know what you're doing that's not a problem.The funny thing is I acutally installed Debian 11 the very day that Debian 12 was relased but didn't know until the next day lol. Though last weekend I installed Debian 12 just for longer support and glad I did. I have to say, I'm probably going to use Debian for years to come and so happy that I'm done distro hopping for good! Thank you to everyone who helps with the developement of Debian. I was so close to going back to using Mint or Windows 10 (I might have tried using Arch).     "

In my personal opinion, Debian 12 is one of the best releases I have tried. I run Linux Mint on my main desktop but Debian 12 is for sure a keeper on my HP laptop.

2842,2023-06-15, Debian, 12,10,14,"Great work as usual by the Debian community and development team, which has outdone itself with this bookworm distribution.Particularly to be appreciated is the default inclusion of non-free-firmware in the main repositories.Installation via the network went smoothly and quickly, resulting in a balanced and fully functional system with excellent graphics. With apt via terminal or the Synaptic graphical apt, which I have been using for years, anyone can install as many software packages as they want according to their wishes and needs without any problems. Also to be appreciated is the clean and elegant Gnome 43.4, which can then be enriched with the available extensions one wishes.A big thank you to the entire Debian community, which for more than 30 years has made available to everyone a free operating system that I personally have been using for at least 20 years and which improves release after release in terms of ease of installation and use, an operating system that in the stable version is an unshakable rock in every situation.Thank you Debian!"
2843,2023-06-14, Debian, 12,10,1,The overall impression about Debian 12 is really positive: I tried it yesterday on my Virtualbox by using 2GB RAM and a dual-core processor and all worked perfectly with great stability as well. Amazing job as usual by Debian developers!P.S: the XFCE 4.18 version equipped with 6.1 kernel ran smoothly and I consider it the best one along with MX Linux's and Loc-OS Linux's.

On the plasma I did a ""light"" desktop install using apt install kde-plasma-desktop plasma-nm in lieu of the task-plasma-desktop. I like having that option. On Gnome it is version 43 which good by me, I have not seen anything in 44 to blow off my side burns. The extensions are what is really helping gnome become more user friendly. Debian needed a new direction and they took it after the vote earlier this year. So I left Fedora and tried on Debian. The fit was good and felt down right ""top-shelf professional"". I don't like Fedora's heavy handed use of ZRAM, I do like Debian does not use it at all. I was pleased to learn Debian is the only distro that votes on their leaders. What a great structure, I can get behind that concept. They have freshened up their desktop experience. Big feature too is the large number packages available for apps. You can install veracrypt easily and I love freefilesync. On fedora you have to get ffs off flatpak but at Debian right there in stable repo.I installed and used Debian a couple of years ago while I was still learning linux. I enjoyed the stability and great documentation but it seemed a bit aged and I simply prefer something easier to install. I'm not crazy about their graphical installer but it will do. I am happy about their firmware change. Like others they are opening up more to flatpaks, these are great decisions.I still have to add some codecs, repos etc. but I can live with that. Soon I'll be installing the xanmod kernel maybe get even more zoom zoom.Okay I'm done. Just having fun now but seriously Debian has made great improvement and I congratulate them for the fine work they produce. It even shows in their classic and artistic themes created with each release. I'll be calling this home for a while, Debian has a lot to offer today. You should not shy away from Debian if tried it in the past and left. I think you will be pleased with the improvements and you have to love the reliability, stability and knowledge filled community that comes built right in.GO TEAM DEBIAN "

2849,2023-06-13, Debian, 11,4,0,Initially impressed with the installer. It allows you to chose which desktop environment withing the installer instead of downloading a iso specifically for the desktop environment you chose. All Linux distros should offer this. More explanation should be available for the  process of selecting the distro because its easy to mes up installation at this point. the amount of fixing after installation is not worth the time. I have to fix the video drivers and i have to ad myself to root to fix the video drivers while looking at a difficult to navigate screen resolution. A distro should work out of the box. Moving on.

Upgrading was miraculously pain-free and fast, unlike in the past when it was like playing Russian roulette with your data. The new Xfce 4.18 is working great, especially with Thunar now offering split view mode (something other file managers like Caja already do).The kernel that ships with this release is the 6.1 series, which is where Rust support is improving. I've also successfully gotten Wayland running with little effort. This is good news, because Xorg is unmaintained while still providing stability over Wayland (which should hopefully change soon).All-in-all, a fantastic job (once again) by the Debian developers!"

2853,2023-06-12, Debian, 12,6,1,"Personally, i dont understand why people say that Debian is good distro, when there is Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora and Manjaro(Arch) available. First impression is very important, and Debian installer is ugly and has too many steps. I was disappointed already during installation. Then, Debian did not installed VM drivers. Why Fedora or Ubuntu can figure it out that they are in VMware, but Debian 12 cant?? Wallpapers with Debian logo are ugly. Also there is a lot of crap that Debian installs by default, for example - stupid logic games. Are you seriously think that everybody need that? Well, but there is no ed editor(which is POSIX requirement). Ed weights just a few KB, but they decided that logic games are more important in Linux system i guess. By the way, by default apt is not working, they force you to go into package manager and choose that you want to use online repos. Why?? Why it is so unbearably bad? And why someone would choose this distro? I was distro hopping for last year, and this is seriously - worst distribution there is. Choose Mint, choose Ubuntu, choose Fedora, choose Manjaro, but for God's sake, dont install this ugly piece of [censored].

I tested out the 9.1 desktop version in VMware.First I tried to install with UEFI firmware, but the installer complained about missing files in the beginning, used a lot of CPU and ultimately crashed.With firmware set to BIOS installation was successful.After running a system update it uses about 1,5 GB of RAM and 8 GB of disk space.In the end this is like Fedora but with outdated software, so I don't know what benefits Eurolinux offers above that distribution.

Because I also have 32-bit Slackware installed on my computer, the boot options menu for this distro came up with multiple copies of booting with Slackware. In addition, the startup messages displayed by this distro were downright confusing, some parts ""systemd"" and others all in plain grey on black.

Bodhi is a distro that does exactly what it sets out to do, it actually hits its target.    It aims to provide support for older hardware or newer hardware for users that want a minimalist approach in an elegant yet light desktop.This is a distro for more hands on types who know what apps they want to run and know what they want in a desktop.    This is not a distro  for Windows only  types who are afraid of a command line and ave no desire to read documentation but it is an easy to use distro with fantastic documentation and dedicated forum support.  The developers are very engaged with their audience.Bodhi is stable. lightweight, fast and elegant.  The documentation is a cut above most distos as is the welcoming tone of the support forum.tfb"
2863,2023-06-25, Bodhi Linux, 7.0.0-beta,10,7,"It is simply the best distro: it has the base of Ubuntu LTS, but at the same time it does not have any of the problems of Ubuntu: its bugs, its snaps, etc. Bodhi is more solid than Debian itself: I've been using it since version 5 (based on Ubuntu 18) and I've never had any bugs. I have installed Bodhi 7-beta and all runs like perfectly.You have to configure it from the beginning, as a Debian. It is heavy work but worth it. The desktop is retro and also takes a lot of work (and knowledge) to set up to your liking. It is not easy to use if you don't know it.I don't know of any other distro that is so light and stable and bug free. The desktop allows for any functionality, although I'm not sure if it will work well with Steam. On old hardware it runs great, on new hardware it flies even faster.My current hardware is a Lenovo that doesn't work well with Wayland or Plasma, it doesn't work well with Linux Mint or Arch either, Opensuse doesn't recognize sound. But Bodhi Linux recognizes everything.n addition, Bodhi Linux supports and collaborates with a Mexican Distro called Escuelas Linux, which is wonderful: it is a Bodhi Linux already configured and loaded with many programs, aimed at poor schools.I love you, Bodhi Linux, and I love you with an everlasting love, eternal flame!

Absolutely no bloat on the standard ISO install. Though I'm not short on either RAM or disk space, efficiency is always welcome.Have noticed some comments about not enough apps in their App Store. As it's Ubuntu LTS based, the repo has thousands of apps that the user can pick based on their preference. It's just for convenience that a handful of the most useful ones are setup so that they can be installed through a web browser. This does not limit the full selection in any way.I prefer the default enlightenment theme and like to keep it minimal.Last but not least, their forum is very welcoming; members and devs are very helpful. I'm not a member but do regularly check them to see what's going on and notice most questions get attended to pronto.Credit goes to Devs for creating such a finely tuned distro. Great job guys :-).

There is a significant learning curve if you want things JUST RITE, and I gave up on it once, but the sheer speed brought me back to spend more time and I am glad I did. It's kind of like when I bought a brand new pickup... there was nothing to DO on it, so I never really bonded with it. Old cars and trucks, yes, you work with them and bond with them or you toss them. Well, Bodhi, after a day or so of tinkering HARD, has produced a workhorse for me. Things like trying to get Google Earth running on it were not trivial with my Intel HD 630 video hardware (HP570), but, as I say, tinkering works, as long as it's not mind blowingly tough. Most other things just work. This distro is almost as fast as Puppy itself, much faster than MX or even Peppermint. I get bored when I have to boot Win 11 for some reason, with the wait times. Puppy is cool, but disasterously tough to work with for me. MX and Peppermint were fun, but MX had too many bugs for my comfort and would not boot on about half of my laptops. Bodhi has worked everywhere and is nice enough looking out of the box to just start using. SPEED and EFFICIENCY of Bodhi, along with its usability make this a KEEPER!"

Everything worked on multiple computer installs. You can do program installs from the app center or appimages. Not an issue for running any program I have found.

There were a couple of bugs but the latest update has fixed everything.  I decided to give this a try just because this computer has been sitting for about 6 years doing pretty much nothing.  I had an old 32 bit version of Deepin on it which I only used to download and burn iso images.  With all of the research and testing different linux distros, I wanted to see just how well an operating system can be designed to run an old machine really well.  I find that this works pretty much as well as the new MX despite the limitations.  For the basic computing tasks that I do, this is fine.  I use e-mail, watch videos, music, etc.  I haven't tried it with Skype or Zoom but I have both of those on my other 2 computers.  Finding this might just be a way to actually run this computer right into the ground rather than tossing it just because it has older hardware.  If you need a simple system for an older computer, I highly recommend this.

A lot of thought and great taste has clearly gone into the theming, icon sets and general appearance. The distro follows a minimalist approach only installing what is needed to get you going. Then you decide what apps you want to build the system you want. As a long time Arch Linux user this approach is greatly to my liking.  because the distro is based on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS you also have all the Ubuntu packages available to you. The Settings Panel gives you a ton of options to tweak and customize the system precisely to you liking. After using the distro for a week on an 11inch screen Lenovo Ideapad I have found it to be stable. I find myself reaching for the little Ideapad more and more often rather than my main laptop which runs Arch. So basically you have a beautiful, tastefully designed, stable, minimalist and highly customizable distro. The only flaws I have found so far is the vast number of notifications you get. They don't get in your way since tou have to open the notification gadget to see them and you can turn them off in the Settings. Also my function  keys don't work.

2897,2021-06-14, Bodhi Linux, 6.0.0,9,6,"I've been interested in this distro since the days of MacPup, but did not get it to work on any hardware I had until 5.0. I've happily used 5.0, 5.1, and now 6.0 on nearly every machine I've had my hands on, and have it on two machines right now. I understand Robert Wiley's reason for having chromium as the default browser, and it's a good one. That doesn't mean I have to use it -- Anyone who wants Firefox can add it easily.The settings are still a royal jumble. It is difficult to figure out what some of them do, and some of the names are quite similar. I'm not ready to use this distro full time, but I use it as a stress relief from Mint or other distros I have to use to get work done.Robert is still working on the 32-bit version of Bodhi 6, but it should be out soon. This is a lightweight distro for a large number of reasons, one of which is that it makes old machines fly, and there are still some old 32-bit boxes out there that need all the help they can get.  You can also easily add Enlightenment E24, although I like Moksha better -- e17 is still the most stable version of Enlightenment, and that's what Moksha is based on. Most of the later new features have been backported to Moksha, so you're not missing much if anything.And did I mention I love green desktops?"
2898,2021-05-19, Bodhi Linux, 6.0.0,10,9,"This distro surprised me, very light and everything works easy. I used Lubuntu on old Pcs but Bodhi is better, because it is faster and lighter in the tests I did 2 old Pcs, 1 dual-core and 1 Atom netbook.For those who don't like the default theme, I recommend trying the MokshaRadiance theme, included in the full version of the distro.Congratulations to the Bodhi team, I will use it as the default system."

2900,2021-05-16, Bodhi Linux, 6.0.0,10,6,"Bodhi is a very nice distro, very elegant and lightweight. It has an Ubuntu base so plenty of software easily available.Moksha, the E-17 based desktop environment might a bit harder for new users and its menu might not the the best categorized one but apart from this it's awesome.There is beauty in efficiency and customisability.I have been using it as main distro from the 2.2 version and I am really pleased with it.I have used/tried many other distros but none of them came close to it in the satisfaction it gave me.A fair rating would have been 9.5 as occasionally there are some small niggles, but the nice dev team tries to solve any they can.Bodhi is truly in line with the distrowatch motto... it really is putting fun into computing. Give it a try!I look forward for the distrowatch review of 6.0 Standard."
2901,2021-05-14, Bodhi Linux, 6.0.0,7,4,"Bodhi has a somewhat unique look, you either love it or hate it. It is extremely lightweight and minimalist and  even manages to  facelift my old and wrinkled 15 year old desktop and make it fly again.On modern harware it is super delicously fast.Cons:The app centerChromium and not firefox  A bug in the live standard iso that does not show a wifi or network icon/ nm applet. This of course can be a major turn off for newbies.But if you are looking for something lighter and faster than the usual suspects Gnome, XFCE, KDE, Mate, Cinnamon then this ""special"" looking little gem might be for you."
2902,2021-05-14, Bodhi Linux, 6.0.0,10,4,"Bodhi 6 is so refreshing ! It is truly Enlightened Linux OS ! So light, pleasing to eyes and get job done without coming to your ways. Very minimal, for me to decide what I want and I have it via sudo apt install or synaptic. I have modern PC and still I find Bodhi 6 as good OS for its speed, simplicity and fact that is is based on long term Ubuntu supported base OS which will ensures stability and security for years. Thanks much Bodhi team for giving this the world! "
2903,2021-05-12, Bodhi Linux, 6.0.0,7,2,"This looks promising for resurrecting old machines. The standard version is minimal to the extreme - Chromium, Synaptic a basic text editor and a terminal is about all you get and I think that's a good idea if you just want a general surfing machine for a bedroom/spare room etc.The DE is going to be Marmite (love it or hate it) to most, but I've always favoured the lighter desktops myself and if learning a new way of doing things is the price to pay for getting a bit more life out of old hardware, then so be it.You probably wouldn't use it on a more modern machine, but aimed at it's target market of ancient beasts, it looks like a real winner."
2904,2021-04-02, Bodhi Linux, 5.1.0,4,1,"Desktop: Moksha is horrendous. You click with the right button and nothing happens. Back to the old school. And green colour is...well, got no words...Menu: boring, not functional at all. Not easy to find what you want.Personalization: booooring and very limited possibilitiesFast? Yes, Bodhi is fast and memory it's ok. But CPU is always higher than average.Sorry, i'm a Windows and a Linux user: i praise functionality overall. Colour effects may be good for kids but when i use an OS i want low resources consumption, light and speedy systems. If i have to struggle only to change the wallpaper or to dig till i found how to change the screen resolution, well, that's not for me. Back to MX (very good but could be better too).   "

2906,2021-01-01, Bodhi Linux, 5.1.0,9,6,"This one is a keeper.It beats the pants off of other OSes in terms of performance. I compared Bodhi on my Core2Duo machine versus W10 on my spouse's i5-2nd generation machine (that is, 2-3 years newer than mine) and the C2D blew it out of the water: much more responsive and far more memory- and disk-efficient.It's attractive and very usable once you set up the way you like. I like the default arc-green theme, but there are many other themes out there in Synaptic. Moksha looks and feels good. It's intuitive and lighter than most other Linux desktops out there, while looking nice and working the way it should. I would recommend swapping out the Enlightenment terminal with something like the XFCE terminal, but that's a personal preference.I've been using it for a few months without any major issues. Any issues can be found easy, since it's an Ubuntu derivative and you won't be the first one to encounter the same thing as many others.A minor downside is the Bodhi Appcenter: it has very few apps and it's just webpages within Gnome Web, aka Epiphany. Synaptic or sudo apt on the command line will serve you much better, though Synaptic is long in the tooth.9/10: me likey and me keepy. It's my reliable daily OS now and for at least the next few months.

2907,2023-05-15, Kaisen Linux, 2.2,10,1,"
I recently had the opportunity to test out Kaisen Linux, and although it is still under development, my initial experience has been quite positive. While I haven't had the chance to explore every feature thoroughly, the aspects I've encountered so far have left me impressed.One standout feature of Kaisen Linux is its streamlined approach to applications. Unlike other distributions that come bundled with a plethora of unnecessary software, Kaisen Linux opts for a more minimalist approach. This not only ensures a lean and efficient operating system but also makes it suitable for running on even the most modest hardware configurations. It's refreshing to see a Linux distribution that prioritizes performance and resource efficiency without compromising functionality.Moreover, I must commend the Kaisen Linux team for their remarkable responsiveness and support. Whenever I encountered an issue or had a question, the staff was quick to assist and provide the necessary guidance. Their dedication and commitment to user satisfaction are highly commendable. It's reassuring to know that should any problems arise, there's a reliable support system in place.Kaisen Linux is undoubtedly a promising project, and I'm excited to witness its future updates. The developers' commitment to refining and enhancing the distribution is evident, and I eagerly anticipate the new features and improvements that will be introduced over time. It's important to note that Kaisen Linux is not a Kali distribution, despite any misconceptions floating around. It has its own unique identity and stands out as a separate and noteworthy Linux distribution.In conclusion, my experience with Kaisen Linux has been predominantly positive. Its lightweight nature, coupled with its dedicated team and responsive support, make it a distribution worth considering, especially for those seeking an efficient and hassle-free Linux experience. While it's still in development, I have high hopes for Kaisen Linux and eagerly await its progress in the Linux community.Ps : It's oriented for sysadmin users"

2910,2022-09-21, Kaisen Linux, 2.1,7,2,"I run this Kaisen on many of my devices. It fullfill my requirenment perfectly. But there are also some caveats, you should know if you didn't use it in the past:- Some Software like Anydesk is broken, because of missing librarys- You should consider using Flatpaks and Appimages, instead of installing it by the package manager- Learn using the BTRFS snapshots, because Updates tend to sometimes break the osBut it also has very much advantages, if you are a experienced Linux user. I'll keep it using on my job and also my private environment. If you had issues, you can always get quick and excellent help on the support channels of the Developer and from other Users."
2911,2022-09-14, Kaisen Linux, 2.1,9,3,"Kaisen Linux ReviewKaisen Linux claims to be a distribution targeted at sysadmins. Having said that, it has a much broader appeal in my opinion.Anyone working in Linux, in a non monolithic environment would really enjoy the diversity of tools available with the standard install, be it for development or troubleshooting.Notably, VirtualBox, QEMU, docker, ansible, VSCodium, Wireshark as well as heaps of other admins and network useful tools, too numerous to mention come pre-installed.I am using the KDE version. I tried the other versions as well but the KDE was the one that worked out of the box with my multi 4K and 2K monitors.Using BTRFS and having a very cool update script which allows for a rapid reversal to the earlier version in case of failure, this is very much a rolling release of Debian. I upgrade my system very night before shutting down and have done so since I started using it two months ago and I have had very few issues. None that were not resolved in record time. More importantly, the maintainer of this distribution is extremely quick in helping anyone who has an issue. Simply go and check-out the forum to see what is a rapid response in support.In summary Kaisen Linux is an excellent BTRFS Debian rolling distribution for sysadmins and developers with exemplary support.

2915,2021-07-15, Kaisen Linux, 1.6,9,1,"BIG download, but it boots extremely quickly from USB and has a huge mainly terminal based amount of software/utilities pre-installed. Firefox comes with several extensions already installed including 'privacy badger' which I've never encountered before.Default full screen terminal is not my cup of tea, nor is double clicking desktop icons - that shouldn't even be there anyway because they're all available via the taskbar. Conky looks professional, but I don't really like RAM expressed as a percentage, I want to see  actual amounts, but they're all minor nitpicks and I would have preferred to see CPU-X in the hardware section too.With Firefox running (single tab) it's using nearly 1.5 GB of RAM which would be a strain on a system with only 2 GB available, but that would be very old systems that probably can't run this 64 bit only version.Doesn't seem to be an install option, but that's not it's forte, it's supposed to be run 'live'As a free alternative to Partition Magic (with LOTS more software/tools than PM) it looks a winner though."

This one just works right out of the box. The only down side (if you want to call it that) is sometimes trying to find a particular program.  There are so many programs, you have to do a bit of menu hopping to find it.  An example is gparted.  Usually it is in the system menu, but here it is under quite a few layers of menus.

I've been using archbang for years and its stability is never let me down. A few weeks ago i installed on an old pc, it went smooth and fast. I recommend using automated system and never try to install such programs like grub manually if you don't know what you're doing.What i like most on archbang that is comes with minimal. Only a browser and terminal. If you love the simplicity and building the system by yourself then this is the best. After installation, you must install gvfs package to access other partitions of your hard drive.Overall, archbang is the best choice among arch based distros."

I would compare an immutable distro to Debian stable, but of course if you like tinkering, customization and / or you depend on native packages this isn't for you of courseI think I haven't even used the terminal, as updates are mostly done with GNOME software but I still do sudo transactional-update dup (which is needed as Aeon does not use Zypper) from time to time and just restart your PC, It isn't needed to do it everyday and you can easily do it every week or two just like TW and you will not have any problemsIf I had t give it some criticism it would be that it does not have YaST which is signature of openSUSE and that the installer while similar to TW and Leap it is a little different and with more of a focus on a Server (which I don't care about) but still does the job"
2928,2023-08-02, openSUSE, tumbleweed,9,2," I prefer rolling releases to ""stable"" distros (stable, yeah, but with an old kernel). I like that everything works, especially now that I have new hardware. I'm in love with Arch, but every time I put ""pacman -Syu"" I pray that the computer doesn't crash. Debian testing was working fine, but, as I often do with Debian, not quite right: I couldn't configure my scanner. Opensuse Tumbleweed has better hardware detectability, it's a rolling release and I don't have the feeling that the computer is going to crash after an update.It took me a while to become friends with opensuse. Ubuntu and Arch were easy for me to set up, Debian was slow to set up and doesn't work very well on my hardware. Opensuse required knowledge to add codecs, repositories, etc. But most of the things I have installed by flatpak and I am happy with the distro. I began with Ubuntu/Debian, after i learned all about Arch and Gentoo, and my last distro has been Fedora/Opensuse. I like rpm's distro. Fedora its not rolling. Pclinuxos is a retro-wave, i prefer beautiful things.Wine doesn´t run as well on opensuse as on ubuntu or debian. Mi old ""Sid Meiers Civilization II"" doesn´t run and its a pitty, i love old games. Other things work well. I ve installed tumbleweed on my desktop pc and on my laptop. Good Job, friends."

For me OpenSUSE and Debian fulfil all my requirements. Linux is really maturing nicely. I use to just dip into it on occasion just out of curiosity but I would never stay.  That has now changed and Im happy using OpenSUSE on my laptop.

The reason it's a 9 and not a 10 is there's barely any documentation, for example, go look at the amd section on the opensuse wiki vs the one on arch.

Not sure if there is a bug in there somewhere, but they all had the same issue.Opensuse Leaf wasn't perfect either actually, as I still can't get any drivers to find the built in Broadcom wifi adapter, but apart from that I was very impressed with Opensuse. Would highly recommend it. Loved the way you can switch at login for Gnome or Classical, etc., which is perfect if you want speed or fancyness when logged in.Just a quick recommendation also to Antix 22 which had no issues on anything and loved the JWM window manager.Many thanks.Steve."

Opensuse is just an average distro.I have chosen 15.3.3 XFCE version to make sure it is dead stable. I have opened an audio file with Praha audio player and cannot close the application. When I close form panel, it still stays on panel. Well, I have to terminate it in the task manager. I have removed screensaver from startup, disabled screensaver form menu, but screensaver appears anyway in the taskbar. Well, kill it. Every time at startup you kill it manually:)Trying to get the panel transparent. I chose solid color, alpha to zero, and no, nothing changes. I need to restart the system to see the transparent panel. Why do I see my internet provider server address in terminal or everywhere as device name?

It was lightning fast, snappy, rock solid and fully equipped with an amazing tool called YaST and KDE as desktop environment, ahead of its time, using a transparent way (Konqueror) to get everything from everywhere to everywhere. A decate now I use MAC OSX until my wife bought a PC. I have been ""distro-hopping"" for about a year now hoping to find the same experience I had back then. Then I decide to go back and look at my old favorite, SuSE. And boom! The Leap version of openSUSE blew me away! It's easy to install, easy to use, fast, snappy, fully featured, YaST, and everything, and it is is rock solid! You can get any sick info you want from google. The software packages are endless. I easily set up pipewire, wine-staging, yabridge, Netbeans, Intellij, VSCode, Java, Gambas, Pascal, Cloud drives, GitHub and run all my media and development projects within a day. The host theme is gorgeous. I didn't have to modify anything. It is probably the fastest distribution, neck to neck with SolusOS. The only ""con"" I can think of, is the slow installation (45 minutes), but it's worth every second... (PC AMD 4core, ATI Radeon Video, SSD 250MB). "

Which installing codecs is a must for most of us.YaST is furnished to deal with the shortcomings of the OS. For me that's a red flag. Whereas an Ubuntu based distribution sets up your printer by auto recognizing on the network, you must use this ""tool"" to get things up and running.If you're seeking something simple such as an Ubuntu based distribution, where you install it and all your hardware works, I'd look elsewhere. If you're up to the challenge, then have at it. Getting my WiFi and nVidia graphics to work properly was nothing short of ridiculous.In the world of Linux, and most things in life, there is always a tradeoff.

I have a Raspberry Pi with Libreelec / Kodi in the living room. I have created a folder share with Samba on Windows 10. So far I have not managed to set up a working Samba folder share with Opensuse. As an alternative, I use Filezilla to create a folder share with FTP from the home directory, but the options are very limited. Until I have an equivalent replacement for Samba folder sharing, I'll continue to use Windows 10 in dual boot mode. Otherwise, everything works fine and I think Opensuse / Gnome looks better than Windows 10. My computer will not get a Windows 11 update, so I use Opensuse Tumbleweed as a replacement.

I used to only use stable releases, but I tried Tumbleweed a year ago and it turned my user experience upside down. In my opinion it is more stable than fixed releases + always fresh software and I think the most stable KDE. Now Tumbleweed is on my desktop and laptop, and for a year now I have not known any problems, except for those that I sometimes do myself)) I use Opensuse for programming in Python, surfing the web and sometimes for playing games via Steam.

What I like about openSUSE in it's current form, it still has the traditional YaST tools but is packed with the latest linux features and configured properly out of the box to make use of them. automatic btrfs snapshots instead of messing around with timeshift and rsync for ext4.Kernel 6.3 plays nicely even with my ancient Radeon HD 6770 GPU which I'm using on an MSI A320M-A PRO MAX along with a Ryzen 5 1600 and 16GB of DDR4-3200 RAM using the XMP profile and a 1TB SATA SSD.

2944,2023-05-08, openSUSE, tumbleweed,10,3,"I was searching for  rolling release distro which works great with KDE and I've found it.I started my Linux journey on Ubuntu, but due to their recent political decisions I wanted a different distro. For my work PC's I've chosen Mint, since they just have to always function and I am very satisfied with that. But for my personal desktop I wanted something more up-to-date.openSUSE Tumbleweed has been perfect so far. I have to agree that it's probably a bit much for complete beginners, but if you have used Linux for some time and are looking for a rolling release distro you should definitely check out Tumbleweed. The installer does look different than your standard Calamares, but I didn't find it hard to use. I went with the standard options most of the time and everything works.BTRFS with automated snapshots works out of the box, you don't even need to configure it. That's insane.In the reviews here are a few complaints regarding the multimedia codecs and YaST which I want to address. You have to install the proprietary multimedia codecs after installation once, yes. But this is well documented, it's literally two lines in the console OR you can even do it graphically by setting a check mark in YaST. I didn't find this to be difficult at all. The same goes for the Nvidia drivers, which I didn't have to do as I use an AMD graphics card.Regarding YaST I have to agree that it's kind of sad it has to exist in the first place. But it handles a lot of problems for which you have to google console commands on other distros graphically, which is nice. However, some aspects of it could definitely be updated.Lastly I want to add that TW has been flawless for gaming as well, but I assume this is the case for basically all distros at this point.To conclude I can highly recommend openSUSE Tumbleweed if you're looking for a rolling release, but don't quite want to go to Arch level like me. Especially if you enjoy KDE Plasma. Some previous experience with Linux may be beneficial, but I can imagine that even fairly unexperienced people could handle this distro, if they have a bit of time on their hands."
2945,2023-05-03, openSUSE, tumbleweed,1,0,"Looks good but that's just KDE Plasma.Going through the install process takes some time. You really have to stop, take a look around and figure out what to click and where to get what you want. After that's done, you have to wait and wait for it to process.Out of the box, you have to fix all the hardware it doesn't find. That takes some time. Not a good first impression. I had to install other repositories to get my video and WiFi to work. So this kicks off the downward spiral.Next you need media codecs. That's a whole other headache. The default repositories don't have what you need. So now you have to add the Packman repository. This now starts to complicate things even more. Packman and openSUSE repositories do not coexist in a friendly fashion. And so excels the downward spiral into migraine land.As you add this repository and that repository to get things going and bring it to a usable state, updates begin to have conflicts. You need to use YaST to get your printer to work?openSUSE is just too cobbled and convoluted for me. So this is a very hard pass."

Since the launch of Windows 10 my concern for Microsoft's desire to invade my privacy has been a concern. In the process it forces you to setup a ""Microsoft Account"" which ties all your information to them, I suspect their end goal is to eventually get you pay a monthly fee to use your computer. I have been using OpenSUSE for everyday tasks and decided to try loading Steam on it to see if it could play games. It runs flawlessly. To say I am impressed would be an understatement. some games run better that on Windows (Mirror's Edge, Final Fantasy, Cities Skylines). I have gotten rid of Windows altogether, and wish I had tried running games on Linux sooner than I did. OpenSUSE is easy to use, customizable, stable, and respects your privacy. The reason I am giving it a 9 out of 10 is the Yast partitioner. It has sucked for years, is not user friendly or configurable, and continues to be used much to my chagrin.

It just does most things right.- Always up to date packages, on par with Arch. - Unlike Arch, no risk in updating because you can always roll back an update if something doesn't work afterwards. Same for administrative tasks done with Yast.- Yast: it's incredibly useful. The equivalent to the Control Panel in Windows. No more config files or searching for ""magical"" terminal commands online. Want to turn on a service at boot? A few clicks in Yast. Want to set up KVM + Qemu + Virt-Manager? A few clicks in Yast. Want to install or remove packages, manage your repositories, remove unneeded leftover dependencies, and so on? All dont in Yast. Firewall settings? Yast. Boot settings? Yast. Partitioning and mount options? Yast.- Finally a distro that treats KDE Plasma with respect. It's the first option in the installer, followed by Gnome and Xfce.- The installer is amazing, you can select or remove every single package you want or don't want. You can go as minimal or ""full"" as you like. Full-disk encryption is also just a click away.If I could improve a few things, I would personally like to have:- ZRAM and btrfs compression by default, like Fedora.- Some way to avoid the Grub password for decrypting the disk when full disk encryption is enabled. Not sure how that's done, maybe through the TPM? My Windows work computer has FDE and doesn't ask me for a password, and the same goes for my Android phone. So it might be possible but I'm also not aware of any other Linux distro that does it.- Flatpak and integration in Discover/Gnome Software by default. On a rolling system like Tumbleweed I feel safer having my stuff installed as Flatpaks as I know they can't break my system after an update. On Leap it would also be useful as the repo software is outdated. openSUSE MicroOS is an immutable system that relies on Flatpaks, a very interesting approach.- An option for a minimal KDE/Gnome desktop, like it's the default for MicroOS. Yes, you can remove the ""KDE/Gnome applications"" pattern in the installer but by default it will install all the applications like LibreOffice, Gimp, Kontact and so on. In (K)Ubuntu they just have a checkbox saying ""minimal install, only browser, terminal and text editor"" which would be an easier way. But it doesn't really matter, you only install it once (which your personal package selection if you want) and then you can run it forever!Where would I be without openSUSE? Fedora is too unreliable. Updating every 6 months can go very wrong and break the system (happened to me before). Silverblue/Kinoite are interesting but not completely ready for prime time as not all apps are available as Flatpaks.Ubuntu/Kubuntu/KDE Neon work fine, but if you're on the LTS track you have 2 years of outdated packages and an outdated desktop (missing out on all those sweet KDE bugfixes) while on the 6-months update track you have the same risk of system breakage every 6 months like with Fedora. Also, Snap are bad apparently, so I've heard.Debian? Even more outdated packages and needs much more tinkering compared to Ubuntu to make it work well.Something Arch-based? Too much work and maintenance, too unreliable in the long run.Gentoo? Slackware? Void? Too nerdy and complicated. My computer should be cattle, not a pet.Solus? I heard nice things, but apparently it's dying."

It offers all the latest software versions, since it is a rolling release distro. But at the same time gives quite a good a good protection against system breakage. First they actually run an integration test suite so many things get caught even before they would be released into repositories. And secondly, even if these tests do not catch some problem, openSUSE provides a great integration with BTRFS, so a system snapshot is automatically made before the package upgrades and after them. So if something goes wrong you can simply select an old working system snapshot from GRUB boot loader.Another thing I like about openSUSE is that they have superb integration and support for KDE Plasma desktop, which in my opinion is the best desktop in industry (powerful, elegant, quite lightweight, customizable, flexible, innovative). Other desktops are also very well integrated and they offer all of other choices. So you are free to select what you like the most. I also like their YaST system configuration program, it is one of the best, I only find Mandriva/Mageia Control Center better than this.Since this comes with the latest packages and kernel also the hardware support is great.

Install that repository.Want your hardware to work? Get ready cause you're going to spend some time searching for a fix. And if you're lucky to get it fixed, beware that a file update can undo what you spent a lot of time doing.Frustrating doesn't even begin to illustrate this whole experience. I have tried many upon many distributions and none have even come close to this level of ineptitude.Software, codecs, drivers... all have separate repositories which conflict with one another. This is the wild wild west of distributions.This is a very hard pass for me..."

Love it or hate it, Ubuntu has the edge over most in this area.I see many reviews praising YaST. Why I don't know. What this tells me is, our operating system lacks simplicity therefore requires an exclusive tool, or set of tools, to manage some basic things. Printers for example... what the what?!KDE Plasma is great! But what some developers do with it isn't always great. For that reason, you can't expect every KDE Plasma experience to be the same. openSUSE definitely creates a different experience and not in a positive way.I'm a believer in installing an operating system and things just working. Sure, you may have that one odd piece of hardware you bought off of eBay that doesn't play nice. Overall, it should just work. No matter how nice or involved the community is, I don't want to spend hours on end trying to get something such as my WiFi working. Or my printer. Or my GPU.Again, love it or hate it, Ubuntu has the edge over most in this area. The proof is in it's popularity in the real world.openSUSE is intriguing.

Root partition too small and the system is also bloated.Pamac-AUR isn't well configured, and it shouldn't include a custom kernel with a custom grub config.Chaotic-AUR repo shouldn't be included in pamac.conf.

I have extensive past experience of using CentOS 7 + 8 as a development workstation so when looking for a distro to use on my home laptop RHEL 9 became a contender. I am using the free developers license so I have access to updates from Redhat.RHEL is perfect for my requirements. A rock solid GNOME desktop not too far behind the upstream. The default repos are light on packages but can be supplemented with EPEL, RPM Fusion, Flathub and (did I mention I was a developer?) the occasional package compiled from source.Not to everyone's taste but I cannot see why I should not keep using this distro for a good long time."

I am a scientific user interested in an OS with a reasonable mix of software range, performance and stability without investing thousands fo $ in hardware every two years.So I gave Centos Stream a trial. I did not have any issues in comparison to the original Centos Linux version so far. I assume the development team forces a conservative approach for the rolling release updates similiar to Microsoft 10 but with less system requirements and less painful private data protection issues. Hopefully this approach will remain for many years. And it would make much sense. For more bleeding edge software with the cost of more unreliability there is Federa in the market which is the way to go for all software enthusiasts. Many experts predict a decline in market share of Centos. I am not sure. Centos Stream will loose some  friends of stable server OS but win some users because of the stable rolling release model. But there is a way to deal with both clients in the update policy of packages.

I like to use Linux as my NAS base OS. This is a great distro for that. Very stable (which is no surprise because it's based on stable Debian) and easy to manage via the WebUI. I almost never have to go into CLI. I've been using since version 4.0 with no issues and have always been able to upgrade to latest version. I have fewer permissions issues with OpenMediaVault than other solutions; this is probably because I am more familiar with Linux than BSD. Supports many file systems including ZFS via the community plugin. I find mdadm more flexible when I need to expand my arrays. I also like that it supports MergerFS and SnapRAID when you don't need a true RAID pool and just want to toss a bunch of random disks together.If you want a very stable NAS distro that is based on Linux, I highly recommend this distro.

It works well enough, but was not getting any new updates, and when I went to find a discussion board, noticed the website is gone.  Maybe it is now dormant or discontinued?  I like how systems like this update as a whole, and the flatpak integration is/was seamless.  I would have continued with it longer had the website not disappeared.

My first time use on my Lenovo laptop has been a mess but I didn't give up.PROA lot of accessories let you manage/rescue your system.CONSThe two main bad things I stumbled in so far are:1. When I close the laptop in battery mode the PC power down. No way to change this behavior.2. If I have HDMI plugged (TV monitor on) but input is not selected, Rescuezilla is not visible because it shows on HDMI.FurthermoreThe overall system is not so responsive as other backup programs I previously tested."
3009,2022-09-22, Rescuezilla, 2.4.1,6,2,"Well, Rescuezilla is getting better from version to version.Language selection again didn't work on my Ventoy stick, so I had to use Balena Etcher again.Unlike with v2.4 regular graphics settings brought me to a usable Desktop.I mounted my USB-HDD in order to store the image, but that resulted in a lot of error messages due to a bunch of Clonezilla images on that HDD, which are somehow incompatible to Rescuezilla. This is not a showstopper, but somewhat annoying ...Creating an image using zstd compression and checking the resulting image went well so far, but think that I can remember Clonezilla being much faster.I'm still missing the opportunity to create and check an image in only one step instead of two ...I didn't yet test the retore function of Rescuezilla.Yes, Rescuezilla seems to be on a good way, and I think it's much easier to use than Clonezilla, which, on the other hand, offers a lot more functions, at least for advanced users."
3010,2022-08-20, Rescuezilla, 2.4,8,1,"This software is GREAT! I had been using clonezilla for ages and although I was able to navigate it fine it still felt stiff and outdated. I found out about Rescuezilla from Distrotube and quickly loaded it on to my ventoy. It is seamless and quick, the rescuezilla software loaded instantly and was easy to understand. Successfully cloned a partition and a full drive for test purposes and it worked perfectly well, in fact I'm writing this review using an OS I cloned onto a USB from a smaller USB using Rescuezilla. My only issue is that there is no network discovery after turning on wifi. I enabled the wifi setting and attempted to manually add my network before giving up and moving on to other tests since internet wasn't my main goal, but it would be helpful for sure since I'd have access to troubleshooting resources while using the program. Otherwise everything else about it was fantastic, the desktop environment, the full OS suite, all very useful and all very promising!"

Since the rescuezilla program starts automatically after booting, it should be possible to use that USB drive for storing the image when this drive is plugged in while the rescuezilla app is already running, but it does not get recognized. Thus I had to quit the app and restart it manually.I created the image using zstd compression. After that I tested the verify function, but that ended reproducible in a quite strange error message printing a python backtrace.I wanted to google that error message, but it was impossible to access the internet via WIFI due to an issue with DBUS and wpa_supplicant. After that I gave up testing Rescuezilla ..."

My sole interest in Rescuezilla was cloning USB full installs of Linux OS to new USBs, and Rescuezilla didn't disappoint. The GUI is very easy to follow, just select the ""clone"" option while having your source and target USBs ready. On an i7 with 32GB memory, it only took Rescuezilla 12.2 minutes apiece to perfectly copy source to new. Flawless results; down to personal files perfect copies of partitions and files were had...I can't tell by looking at and using the OS copies whether I'm using the original OS or its clone. I make no claims about other concerns re this multi-purpose tool, but insofar as cloning Linux full-installed to USB my experience with it allows me to greatly recommend it for such cloning purpose.

I find it to an excellent solution for a reliable system image backup.Dell XPS has HiDPI monitor which no live boot distros have found a genius solution for. The text is so tiny I have to stick my face in the screen to barely make out what it says to change the resolution.Since 2.3 release I am making a donation to help continue this ""save your buns program"".When I use to distro hop I came one that during the live boot it ask first thing before loading the desktop what resolution choice you desired. I thought this would be an good make-shift solution till a more eloquent one is developed. It could be loaded with large text and image so it is easier to see on 3860 wide screens. This would be far better than the solution clonezilla offers, which is basically little no improvement for the users eyes.Aside from this, I love the product."

I have successfully used all key features on several different machines: backup, restore, and clone. Contrary to the information in previous reviews zstd compression is included. Zstd works well, although extreme compression is slow, but that is zstd not Rescuezilla. The standard gzip is quick on my computer even at maximum compression. 2.3 includes a useful verification feature. The developer has a detailed development plan and is active and responsive to user input. As a long-time Acronis TrueImage user I am impressed and am in the process of moving to Rescuezilla as my main backup tool.

Really lame"
3016,2021-10-28, Rescuezilla, 2.2,10,35,"My overall impression is very good.I have been experimenting with Rescuezilla and everything I have tried has worked.One successful trial of Rescuezilla was to image from one laptop to another, where the two machines were completely different.And furthermore - the second one had a smaller SSD.I used the workaround described by the author, which involves using the built-in gparted program, to shrink the partition on the first machine to less than the size of the smaller SSD on the second machine.You can choose the compression level of the image file, although I stuck to the default level 6.The GUI was clear and intuitive.I used it on a laptop for testing various distros - by installing, setting up, imaging - then wiping and installing the next distro.  The images made it possible for me to go back to any distro and take it further.Each image took about nine minutes to make, and about nine minutes to restore.This is on a seven-year-old laptop with UEFI and a Broadcom graphics card."
3017,2021-10-13, Rescuezilla, 2.2,10,0,"I've had very few problems with this system overall. On the few occasions, I have encountered issues I have narrowed it down to being hardware-related and not because of RescueZilla.The developer is building a community around a well-maintained piece of software offering two releases per year. Built on top of Ubuntu, you can expect a new release approximately a month after an Ubuntu release.Since I don't use imaging software on a daily basis to make another product worth paying for, and I typically backup to a Network Share, I don't mind a little slowness that sometimes happens. The bottleneck after testing has usually been the destination, whether that be a NAS or an external hard drive. Not all storage is created equally.

Batocera v36, primary use as media-center, additional file-server, and gaming system. Experienced user, Linux, BSD, Mac, Windows (Unix, DOS, CPM), I rate Batocera easy to use and very stable.Pros:Highly recommend for use when mixed user skills require easy interface, under the hood (ssh) its very manageable to admin remotely,As example, the TV Media Center system has 32TB raid-one setup (supports mdadm & smartctl) and sufficient maintenance tools . The operating system is rock solid, has been indestructible through many storms & brownouts, about the only time the system reboots, very good up-time (no UPS).  The well integrated Kodi, Emulation Station, and emulation works smoothly, easy for inexperienced casual users.I transfer files thru SSHFS, mounted in Linux, but FTP and SMB (windows) shares works as well.  Built in scraping is awesome.Very compatible with old & new systems, currently using on TV for games & movies, Raspberry pi in multiple bedrooms & kitchen, a few old laptops, plus an older mac mini throughout the house. Use inexpensive remotes, Bluetooth game pads, light guns, etc.I have used for years, look forward to every release with new features and improved compatibility with both hardware and games. Support, wiki & forum very helpful.Tried many comparable systems, although I can deal with more complicated systems, guests, family, and grandchildren find the seamless use of emulation station as the front end easier than a phone, anyone can just walk up and start playing.Cons: I honestly can't provide a negative, like asking for more porridge."

It is great on Raspberry Pi as well. I love that they have an easy way to update to the latest version and to install onto a new device from a configured USB drive. The only drawbacks I can think of is that it isn't easy to add ROMs to the drive. You either need to use a separate USB drive with ROMs on it (on PC) or transfer via FTP. Also, deleting files can stay in your trash can if you don't look and will sometimes fill up your storage. At least they added a function to look in your trash can now so you can empty it.Overall, easy to use, cool customized UI with nice theme and music, great tweaking tools to make your experience tailored to your use case."

None comes close to Batocera. They support emulators for every old gaming console you can imagine (Atari, Nintendo, Amiga, Genesis, GameBoy DS, PlaySation, Gamecube)... but they also give you PS2, Xbox, Wii, PS3 and WiiU!! And if that was not enough, you can also play all your PC games: from MSDOS to Windows 95/2000. But that's not all: they embed the wine emulator, so that you can play also some of your current Windows10 games on Linux. I tried to use wine on Ubuntu, and never figured out how to configure it. Batocera made it dead simple for me.I donated a few bucks, so they can keep up the good work. Also, versions 30 and 31 are already out by the time of this review. Can't wait for the next release.

-1 star for LXQT for not being anything remotely ready for primetime. Buggy, incomplete, problematic. That was day 1. Installing XFCE was a gigantic relief because that would assemble and was a nifty, complete implementation.-1 for closing their email list (""new registration no longer accepted"") to people that want to join their community. Mastadon/IM just seems like a poor alternative since many of us don't want to IM.Other than that, great adventure. I had to raise my modest skill level to make this work. It's a skeleton CLI operating with no DE, a few degrees separated from Linux From Scratch, and you are in the complete control. I loved it. If forces you to really think about what you are installing. You enable your own services.You can read all the comments on here, or all the internet reviews, and they are all torn on one thing. Half the people believe this is just a Server distro and the other half think it's a Complete Desktop experience. I wanted a secure Daily Driver and I got one. Was it meant for this? I don't know yet.Kudos to their fantastic and easy documentation. Problems will come up in configuring as you go, and all of mine could be remedied quickly with their information.This has no bells and whistles or flash outside of what xfce4 offers, and if you want bells and whistles, Alpine will be happy if you go back to Ubuntu. I respect this. Alpine is very much a mindset.I eschewed their own awall for ufw, and had to install iptables, but that's part of the fun. I pick and choose. OpenRC is fast fast fast.I have 5 of their repos enabled and it's a modest offering with firefox and chromium the only GUI browsers really. When there are about 6-7 vim/keyboard browsers curated that should tell you something.....:) All my favorite CLI tools are there. And it supports Flatpak so I really have to be conservative in my approach but I love the option.I like Alpine and I'm sticking with it. I wrote this on day 4 of using Alpine daily."

This forces you to sometimes manually compile things, which is often fine and also educational, but it sometimes causes headaches.

I prefer Fedora for my desktop for ""reasons"", but Fedora server really failed me here. Between systemd-resolved, network manager, and dnsmasq, taking my amateur, basic networking skills to the next level just was NOT happening. There is FAR too much going on there.The Alpine Linux ""sys"" install onto a drive is a classic, minimal Linux installation WITHOUT systemd or network manager. It was/is the best approach I could find to learn the interoperability between iptables/nftables, dnsmasq, and hostapd. Nothing seemed to work until I discovered some iptables bits on a Ubuntu forum that finally enabled comms between my LAN, WLAN, and the internet. (I did a lot of reading - books even. But all the books are old too, and describe iptables and BIND in great detail.)As of 3.17, I found the iptables package pretty much ""broken"" out-of-the-box, along with dnsmasq. The dnsmasq service sets up a bridge on 10.0.x.x behind your back AND a firewall with iptables rules. The iptables package wouldn't open up my traffic with some very, very basic FORWARD rules for my subnets. nftables saved the day, but the default nftables.conf also breaks a basic home router table. I'm sure none of that makes sense. OH, and the ""net.ipv4.ip_forward"" bit wasn't set by default. But nftables was easy to fix. The dnsmasq service file had to be pared down to a regular service that depends on ""firewall"". And the nftables package provides that.

I saw Alpine Xen recommended, and I was impressed by the small download size.Fell in love at first login.  Nothing bad to say.

AND, I did not try other windowing systems, so there's more to be tried in the X / GUI department.3) It's based on musl libraries, not glibc.  I'm not expert enough to know the pros and cons, but it works.  The main con: AFAIK, you can't run glibc-linked binaries- you have to get the musl version, or compile it yourself.  All that said, I find every package I could want is available in Alpine repositories.  (I do coding and compiling, so that wouldn't be a problem if needed).4) From the start I've felt strongly that good package management is critical to any Linux distro.  Alpine's apk works very well, but I would prefer more functionality, and maybe a GUI front-end.Alpine is not advertised as ""rolling release"", but every time they've come out with a new version, apk has no problem upgrading everything correctly, no problems.

Also, wireless was not part of the initial install, had to do that separately, but that might be because it didn't detect the onboard card.Running now for a week with no issues, decided against running in graphical mode due to small disk and RAM - was able to get BOINC running along with cmatrix as a terminal screensaver, so it's happily sitting on a corner of the desk churning away.Originally was in the same camp as another reviewer about a dearth of packages, then discovered the ""edge"" repository, and OMG there's a boatload of them available."

Recently I have purchased a secondhand laptop, Compaq CQ 58. I want to use this laptop for work at home. Mailing, text-editing, watching movies. The laptop is more than ten years old, and I tried a number of distro's on it. But al them made the laptop extremely slow. Except Salix. Salix is a real good choice for people to use at work as well as al home. All the necessary programs ( Libreoffice, Gimp, mail, firefox, cups, etc.) are installed by default. And it is extremely light on system resources. Salix is based on Slackware, so there is absolutely no desktop oriented distro more stable than Salix. I wish there could more publicity give to this Operating System, because it very suitable to use in offices or at home. It deserves a lot more credit than it receives right now. (Maybe a review at Distrowatch could help in this regard). As a con could be taken that the installation is not graphical like many other distributions today. The install-program is dialog-based in the terminal. For me, there is no problem with this but maybe for other users it could be a little scary.  There is also a live version with a very barbones graphical installation method.A great distro, deserving much more appreciation. Kudo's to the developers!"
3050,2023-07-17, Salix, 15.0,9,3,"Awesome Slackware-based distribution that makes life easier for the average lazy Slacker. Especially with Slapt-get (same as Apt/Apt-get/Aptitude/DPKG in Debian/Devuan). Dependency correction is a feature, and it prevents the user from installing so much cruft I got a ""full"" Xfce desktop with my favorite GTK/Qt programs (including SlackBuilds and packages converted with DEB2TGZ), and it barely uses more than 1,000 packages. On my Dell laptop, uses barely 500 MB on boot, and it stays at 600-700 MB after a few days have passed.If I had some constructive criticisms, they would be to replace Firefox with a lighter/privacy-oriented alternative (e.g. SeaMonkey, Pale Moon) and make Flatpaks completely optional (I had to remove that bloat after install).The SLI (Salix Live Installer) is very thoroughly straight-forward and more user-friendly than even the overrated Calamares. On top of that, you have the choice of using LILO as your bootloader.If you prefer something more UNIX-like and as close to the *BSDs as possible, but Slackware is too overwhelming for you, then Salix or even Slackel would be the two respins of it to give a shot. You won't regret it."

A lot of time is wasted.Looking for a slackware based distro I found Salix os and I am really surprised.The distribution is easy to install, and is less tedious than slackware.The package system is very good and resolves dependencies.  I haven't had any problems so far and it works fast.What was not in the repositories I installed from slackbuilds.I like that it comes with Xfce that looks great and needs almost no configuration to get it just the way you want.From sclackware there are many more things to configure.It is incredible how fast Salix is, on this netbook I had tried Debian, Devuan, Peppermint, none runs as fast as Salix.The ram memory in idle marks 350mb.Salix comes with graphical tools to manage the packages, and also the services. I've been using linux for years and love using the terminal, but I find these tools to be a great addition. I also liked Salix's page. It has a very good guide to start using the system.I congratulate those who are behind Salix. I think slackware is unique in the linux world and has many advantages over others.Having said that I think salix is a breath of fresh air. Something that slackware itself doesn't have, unless you invest your time. Highly recommended!"

I haven't used anything but Salix 15.0 since it was released last September, and don't intend to.  It uses Flathub to install programs not found in GSlapt, and they work seamlessly, the kernel is an LTS kernel, Firefox is up to date, and ESR.

3056,2023-03-18, Salix, 15.0,2,5,"Pretty distro, but that's the only ""pro"". The Slackware packaging method is a mess with all the constant bloat of not separating lib packages from daemons or main ones. For example, despite being on xfce4 and xorg, I could not get my programs to work without wayland installed. On Debian, you just need the lib files of wayland for xfce4 to work. That ensures dependencies are met without having the actual display server, too. Also, if you want to use alsamixer, make sure pulseaudio is installed. Very confusing."

3058,2022-11-30, Salix, 14.2.1,9,5,"I generally do not write reviews of Linux Distros, but feel that I have a point of view and information of use here.   Having used many differing forms (Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora, Manjaro, PCLinuxOS, Gentoo, Mx-Linux, EasyOS and ClearLinux among others and even a few BSD forms) I can say that Salix has been a very pleasant surprise.    Using Elilo is different from Grub2, but really is generally of no concern in the difference for any routine usage.Installation was facile and so long as the network was identified early, even a WiFi update could be done very easily to get to a working start.    My display was detected properly without any problem.  Printer use under CUPS-gutenprint was fine.    Even Bluetooth function was accomplished readily.Startup is extremely quick and perhaps the only limitation is the lack of many options for a background.   I can live with the small selection available. Slackware is certainly a valid type of system for running a distro and Salix has made the business of handling dependencies much less burdensome.   Using the Terminal under XFCE, a very serviceable Desktop, or using the GUI both work virtually flawlessly so far as I can tell.   The system has excellent ability to add many applications through its slapt-get and slapt-src utilities in the former and through the Gslapt GUI and this is well supplemented by the incorporation of Flathub for flatpack use.    Beyond that , I have more or less nearly any other package which I can make readily.Many seeking to take the ordinary .gz file can merely take that file and translate it to .tgz which I do easily, though there are conversion programs for this alteration which one can use for the purpose.   Once a .tgz file is created, that file can be managed by using the spkg utility in the terminal under the sudo or root status and this will create a Salix compatible file with installation from the use. I was most pleased to find that there was not even a need to go through the process of upgrading to Salix15.  On noting the release of the new release, at least in the case of my installation, I found that all of the steps for the upgrade had been managed the prior day by using the Upgrade in the Gslapt GUI and there was complete management of all the various steps otherwise to be found in the upgrade. I have been able to make all of my hardware other than scanning work easily.   An Epson Scanner could be added through Flathub and most others could be managed with paid proprietary software available through Flathub as well, though this is not essential to my needs for my unit."
3059,2022-11-11, Salix, 15.0,10,14,Salix is a very well made Linux distribution. It is very fast and easy to use. It has an excellent and fast package manager and an excellent set of tools. It comes with the essential software to get started. It has good language support and a nice responsive desktop environment.

3063,2022-09-24, Salix, 15.0,6,0,"Salix 15 is for a Slackware-based distro supposedly easy to install but still their installer looks way too obsolete and keyboard controls during installation would surely feel cumbersome for newcomers and (spoiled) veterans. Hey Salix folks, SUSE had a better installer back in 2001! ""Optimized for desktop"" means graphical installer in 2022. Of course if you pay increased attention you're going to pull it with a little bit of effort. Installation defaults are generally reasonable. Installer asks you to set a relatively stronger password than usual but this is a justifiable requirement. You boot into an XFCE with an attractive theme and a nice desktop background to greet you. Thankfully, Salix uses whisker menu. Desktop feels very responsive. The default selection of software (if you go for the ""full"" installation as I did) is a mixed-bag. A full-fledged LibreOffice installation ticks a box. However, we get Firefox-ESR for some reason. Is Salix in the league of LTS / stable distros? Why not the main-branch version of Firefox? Nothing wrong with the ESR. Works fine on Debian. An odd choice all the same. Claws-Mail as default email client. An obscure application that automatically cast a shadow of doubt over Salix and their team. What they thought? Yeah, GSlapt software manager can remedy that. It's a very tidy software manager in the vein of Synaptic. Asunder CD ripper...! One of the best but too retro, no? Who's installing this by default on their distro today? In addition to these obscurities, we find some crappy vanilla XFCE apps, almost every other XFCE distro drops. Default software selection leaves much to be desired. I know I can install my software of choice but I can install Slackware instead as well. Salix is lightweight, well-performing distro which lacks the polish and cohesion of other XFCE offerings. Slackware die-hards stick with the real thing, Slackware itself. Systemd haters? They will find a much more complete system in MX. Looking for an easy XFCE? Mint, Lite, Zorin is the way to go. Salix feels like a ""family"" project, with some amusing retro and subjective touches. "

Even though I don't use it because I am very comfortable with my current Linux distribution, I probably would have a good time with Salix. Also not that bloated (850 packages) for a ""full"" operating system. Sadly based on a distribution that is pretty inconsistent, which is why it took so long for Salix to have a new release, however if you are not happy with Ubuntu, Manjaro et cetera, then try out Salix, and give then some love."
3066,2022-09-10, Salix, 15.0,10,21,"The best way to describe Salix is 'Old Faithful': It's like that comfortable old armchair or those well worn in boots that you know you can rely on when the new furniture disappoints with its poor build quality, or when your expensive new designer shoes give you corns and blisters.Salix is 'Old school GNU/Linux', based on the longest serving GNU/Linux build; still proudly (and reassuringly) holding high the FOSS standards of do one thing and do it well; no creeping systemd here; no wadges of software that all do the same thing; no forced cointainered apps... This is GNU/Linux as it was intended to be. Thank the stars it hasn't been dragged into the same sort of modernity wished for in other comments here.I'll take my GNU/Linux straight, thank you."
3067,2022-09-06, Salix, 15.0,10,6,"Bottom line. Salix is not the most user-friendly distro, sometimes you need to install some more packages to make everything work as you wish, (e.g. wi-fi drivers), which is not ideal, right? But then, what is it that makes Salix 15.0 so different from other GNU/Linux distributions?Well, Salix is fast, simple, has a nice and responsive desktop environment but above all, Salix is rock solid.As Neil Armstrong once said “Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.” With Salix is the same in every release.Everything is smooth, composed and well done. Must be the nearly thirty years of Slackware's legacy. You get the results you want, and if you're willing to make the ride, you'll get there. Predictable, I think is the right word. You know what's going to happen, and there will be no nasty surprises.Overall, Salix 15.0 is a well-achieved product. In the areas where it fails, it is done on purpose. It is not a bad guarantee of quality. Consequently, recovery from these failures is fairly straightforward. As you use the distro, you can like it, and forgive yourself some of its flaws. I know it is not a beginner system but that is not the target of this distro either. But I think any user can install it and use it without problems.Worth your time, for sure."

Today, I am shocked to see that Salix really hasn't changed very much since 2017! It's got the same clunky installation process, and I don't see any modern advances. In fact,you almost have to know code to run it live. Come on guys! You can do better than this. Can anyone bring Slackware into the 21st century? Like Mint has done to Ubuntu? Like Manjaro has done to Arch? Like Neptune has done to Debian? Perhaps not. I guess that's too much to ask for. "

Otherwise no problems so far, bluetooth worked fine after installing the Blueman via Gslapt package manager of Salix. Pulse audio worked fine with bluetooth. Appimage apps worked fine as well.

Fixing this problem is not very difficult, but you have to know how to do it.Updating the installed system was fast and without any problems.

3073,2021-02-24, Salix, 14.2.1,8,1,"Had been a Salix user for some time (years) but a few things were/are holding it back for me personally. The system itself was always solid and dependable.  Loved the Salix tools, after all I am a lazy Slacker.It was the software, mainly LibreOffice. I wanted/needed a newer version to keep up with MS Excel 365 mostly. I had spotty success in installing a later version of LibreOffice using AlienBobs builds and the needed dependencies. Same process but different results at times.I want XFCE, (can tolerate Mate or Cinnamon) and NO systemd.When a newer version of Salix comes out I will be torn. I have been using Devuan as of late and it's been OK also.My wife likes Salix and she DOES NOT like change and is NOT a techie. She would give it a 9.5 at least.

Of course, it could have been installed, but I wasnt adept at bsds at the time.I later installed it again in 2023, then on a new PC. Unfortunately, my graphics core was not handled by ghost (free) bsd, so I bought an nvidia quadro vga for only $20.There is a picture, but it could be sharper! The picture is better under Linux!Installation was easy. Octopkg is integrated, which is a graphical 1 click install style package management and installation application.There was 1 error: That the data copied to the nt partition is deleted after restarting or turning it off and then on. According to the freebsd forum, this is a bug that can be fixed by umounting the nt partition before turning it off.The Xscavenger game exits after 1 minute.Libre office is not included in the package by default.The virtual box failed to start with an error message.This distro is better than pcbsd was.

It worked flawlessly on Firefox (113.0.2) even in HD mode. However, I tried streaming the evening news on a local TV channel and then video output was less than ideal, watchable but jittery. This was fixed by altering media.benchmark.vp9.fps from 0 to 60.Tried to playback a video on VLC and found that it didn't default to Pulseaudio like Firefox, but insists on playing though my internal PC speaker unless I manually change the audio output device to pcm1:virtual:dsp1.vp1.

GhostBSD is getting there and it is certainly an excellent operating system worth a try if you feel that you need a change. Just be aware that it isn't going to be a stroll in the park. It will be more like a walk in the woods without a clear path, but an adventure nonetheless. "
3077,2023-02-04, GhostBSD, 22.06.15,10,40,Very easy to install system. It is very customizable using both the Mate and the community Xfce version (latest release).  Sound and wireless worked out of the box.  Running a dual monitor setup (laptop LCD and external monitor) and both monitors were detected. It is indeed a very elegant system with very few resources used up.  While at idle it uses 1.5GB of ram and CPU sits at 0 to 1 percent (intel i7).  The system is very snappy and is one of the fastest systems that I have used.  The only minor inconvenice is that there is no screen hardware brightness adjustment control (hopefully it can be fixed on the next release). Recommended for both new and experienced users and both will have lots of fun adjusting and tweaking it.  Great job and lots of thanks and kudos to the devs for this great distro.

Also you honestly have to put this BSD distro together yourself, although it does boot to a nice home screen.  Good luck trying to get your printer to work.. etc... I don't want to disrespect Eric the developer of this BSD, he's obviously got other things to do as this is a patchwork.Too bad, as BSD is in sore need of dedicated developers and maintainers who can craft something akin to the many Linux distros out there that are done well.  GhostBSD behaves like Linux from about 1995 or so.  "
3081,2022-06-18, GhostBSD, 22.06.15,8,3,"I've given a rating of 8 because I have used this distro for only a couple of hours. After this short period I am left with a feeling of having spent time with a competently put together OS. I haven't successfully installed BSD prior to GhostBSD because I've not been prepared to invest time in the learning curve required to do so. It does seem that the devs of GhostBSD have tamed the installation because I had no issues at all in getting it up and running. It's not just installation the devs seemed to have polished either. All my new laptop components were recognised and worked, and my trusty old workhorse desktop PC also faired equally well.I am a long-time MX Linux user and will continue to be. I make no comparisons between MX and GhostBSD except to say that they both claim to be easy to install, and I agree with them both. If like me you enjoy trying out distros, I do recommend taking GhostBSD for a test drive."

Good looking.Cons:  No network card support for many newer hardware.  Horrid help forums;  they just ignore you if your issue is a challenge.  No sound support for a lot of hardware;  I've tried to install and use this BSD version on 18 machines now, and TWO of them successfully installed and were usable, both legacy machines (as in old) and both in a donate pile.  This BSD is honestly not for modern machines unless you're lucky enough to have a type the developer has in his house.Sad, because the thing is so good looking, even has polish to it on the desktop.  But no go at all unless you have a supported machine and unless you don't need to hear any sound and don't need to go online (perhaps good for small children to play games on)."

Ghost is intended to be a simple and stable system.  Running on a modest Dell Optiplex and Lenovo Ideapad, it's quick and easy to install, quick in operation and works pretty flawlessly for me with no hardware discovery issues.  The MATE desktop is attractive and configurable with the Station Tweak look changer.  Maybe the reviewers who are so critical with their fussier hardware should reel it in.  It's a well known fact that any BSD system can sometimes be tricky and problematic with certain hardware.  Run Ghost on a suitable machine and it makes a great platform for testing and enjoying the benefits of BSD.  Respect is due to this long running project, and highly recommended if you want a simple out of the box FreeBSD based experience!"

I should have expected this from a distro coming from Canada, the same country that give us Arch. At least Arch doesn't crash until after you run it for 5 or 6 months.

It was a very simple process to install neovim (0.5) straight from the pkg repos' along with the rust and rust-analyzer packages. I really like the fact that sudo is installed by default and seemed to be assigned to the first non-root user created during the setup process since I was able to run ""sudo pkg install"" right out of the box!

First tried it via DVD live disk on my main machine running an AMD Ryzen 5 CPU and Radeon RX570 graphics card, but it choked on my triple monitor setup.   Couldn't get it to run in VirtualBox either.  Switched over to a Windows 10 machine running an Intel Core2 CPU and Radeon HD5450 graphics card attached to a 42"" LCD TV I use as a monitor on the few occasions I want to boot Win10.  Got an ""out of range"" message and stopped me cold.  Used the same machine with a 21"" LCD attached and got to a desktop but the only resolution I could get was 760X640.  Everything was so big I couldn't see most of the windows I opened.  After putting GhostBSD on a thumbdrive I moved to a MiniPC running an Intel i5 dual core CPU and integrated Intel 3000 graphics on  a 21"" LCD and there it was!  Installed it to a spare WD 500Gb SSD drive and it's been nothing but fun ever since. The OS looks good and although there is minimal software installed it only took a few minutes to figure out how to get the programs I use regularly up and running.  It uses the Mate desktop which is what I'm used to in Mint Linux so everything looked very familiar.  About the biggest glitch I found was Netflix won't work in Firefox.  I encountered no other web problems even after importing my favorites from my Mint machine.  Took a bit of searching to get USB drives to auto boot, but it's done and working fine.

3103,2021-01-28, GhostBSD, 21.01.20,9,4,"In its obituary for Steve Jobs, the Economist magazine said Jobs' big win was creating products that we love. I would say Eric Turgeon has done that with GhostBSD, at least in my experience.I just love GhostBSD, which I've been using as my daily driver for more than two months. It's fast and light and beautiful.I'm running it on a big old Dell Latitude E5500 (Intel Core 2 Duo @ 2.261GHz with 4GB RAM). I use it as a desktop, not a laptop, so lack of Wi-Fi isn't an issue. And I don't need to print.UPSIDES:--It's extremely fast, light and well designed.--LibreOffice Writer spellchecking worked out of the box with my preferred language (Canadian English) already set as the default.--I would guess the installed applications are most, or all, of what the average person would need.--Software Station has more than 30,000 packages available.--It prompts you when updates are available, a good feature to have on a rolling release.--About 10 shells are available. Fish is the default though you can choose bash at installation. To temporarily switch to another, just its name (for example, zsh). To return to the default, type exit.DOWNSIDES:--Wi-Fi is not yet available in FreeBSD, on which GhostBSD is based.--Printing doesn't work out of the box. That would be OK on pure FreeBSD (or pure Arch or pure openSUSE), but not on GhostBSD (or Manjaro or GeckoLinux).--The first time I installed GhostBSD on this old Dell Latitude, I used the default ZFS filesystem. It ran so slowly that I uninstalled it after a day. Several months (and versions) later I tried again, this time with UFS, which is lightning fast.BOTTOM LINEGhostBSD has steadily improved since I first tried to install it a few years ago. Out-of-the-box Wi-Fi and printing aren't available yet. But what GhostBSD does, it does extremely well."

Well i have used too much distro. So what about Nutyx, fast package manager and fresh rolling release distro. Although sometimes it may lack of some packages. It's still good. The package manager ""CARDS"" is one of the best. Multiple init system support is perfect, sysv , runit and systemd. Developers are caring about you. This distro is unlisted in Flatpak supported distros but it has good flatpak support. You install it with curses-like screen(i mean distro). This distro works faster compared to a lot of linux distro. Documantations are good. It have a lot of kde cinnamon base etc. isos. "
3109,2023-02-06, NuTyX, 23.01.3,7,9,"First review in nine months but here goes: Before installation it's recommended to set up the disk to install to: ESP, main partition and ""swap"" at minimum. Impressed with the no-nonsense function: basically it makes like it's copying the ISO contents to the target partition, then it asks where to place the bootloader. It cannot recognize UUID's; I think this is something the maintainers should consider. Especially if you like booting off external USB disks you will have to at least edit ""/boot/grub/grub.cfg"" and ""/etc/fstab"".At first I installed XFCE but it had a problem with registering Wifi modem password, which forced me to install KDE Plasma version. This KDE comes without the ability to disable the compositor and a few other annoyances but it's the latest matching Arch-based and other rolling-release distros. KWallet could be buggy; I had to fight with it to get Internet. Sometimes after the system shows SDDM log-in screen it flashes briefly when the user enters the first figure of his/her password. After session start KWrite could open claiming to be maximized but takes up like half the screen; either that or without the window frame and titlebar. I also have EndeavourOS, Freespire, Kubuntu, Manjaro, NeptuneOS, Q4OS and Spiral with the same exact D.E. (some of them older though and too many LOL) which I've never seen that misbehavior. IMHO the Debian-based distros I listed just run this bloatware D.E. faster and better than whatever has the latest release of Plasma. Nutyx KDE cannot even start faster. That's why I wished I had it with XFCE instead.On a Saturday after I saw on this site that there was the 23.01 update, I wound up spending the good part of an hour breaking and starting ""cards"" on the terminal and fighting with my slow Internet connection.  Chiefly it updated the Linux kernel to v6.1.9, Firefox, a bunch of KDE stuff, ""cards"" and ""nutyx"" themselves, ""systemd"" and ""llvm"" which might not even be used, and more.I advise against using FLCards GUI program -- too stiff for people used to slick interfaces. ""cards"" program needs a ""verbose"" mode for some things like synching with the repository server(s). ""fuse2"" is needed to run AppImages; it is not provided. Now I'm not sure but it has Flatpak library pre-included. However if you venture to uninistall Plasma Discover it takes down the Flatpak library and other things (including ""fuse2"") which is irritating because if then you ask it to put back Flatpak it puts back those other things *except* Discover.The main developer is around the forum which is otherwise kind of sparse; the site is not for paranoid people that must visit only ""https""-marked places. This is important when you want to create an account, because eg. Firefox could keep warning while an user enters his/her password and then waits for e-mail confirmation to be able to post on the forum.  As it's said on this site's page for Nutyx, this system requires at least intermediate knowledge of Linux and a fast Internet connection. There is no ""multilib"", you'll have to handle it yourself if you want Wine or something else that requires 32-bit mode. One advantage I have a burning desire to utilize is its ability to operate within another Linux system, chiefly to increase Nutyx the distro's available packages.by mnrv-ovrf-year-c"

I found cards, the packages manager quite easy to use. I did appreciate the possibility of installing a set of packages in one command (e.g. cards install devel to install all the packages required for development - and more).The fact that NuTyX comes as a rolling release is a plus for me (I could not test it though). Upgrading Debian has always been a challenge for me.Overall I give it a 7/10, mostly for the installation process, which, compared to Pop!_os, for instance, is night and day.Keep up the good work, for now, I stick to Pop!_os but will definitely keep an eye on it (also because I'm french ;-)"

3118,2021-01-21, NuTyX, 20.12.0,10,3,"Excellent desktop variety, excellent package manager, and Stable as a rock, NuTyX is a Distribution that is quite literally for everyone. There are live images with preinstalled desktop environments and an FLTK frontend for the Cards package manager (a fork of CRUX's PRTutils, which also needs a mention), there are minimal images with an Ncurses installer and almost no packages, and you can even download the installer script seperately and install it from within your own distribution! And, you can choose between stable releases and a rolling-release mode that is actually pretty stable, too! The only time I ever broke it was when I accidentally removed a ton of packages when I typed the wrong command. The documentation is pretty good, too. It's not Slackware-level documentation (trust me, Slackware's documentation is better than even the Arch wiki), but it's pretty good. And, the notion of ""collections"" allows you to install multiple desktops without interference. In fact, the whole system is modular, so when you uninstall a package, you don't lose a bunch of nessecary packages because they're bundled with the package that's getting uninstalled. Great work, NuTyX team! You really have something great going on here! Easy10/10!

I really want to like this distribution but unfortunately it has serious problems with keeping up to date. A lot of packages are outdated with breaking bugs, they have been reported on the official bug tracker but they are just not taken care of. They pride themselves for being faster than the other RHEL alternatives to ship releases but they are way behind. Officially it is at 8.5, but many packages are still on 8.0, which is obviously not good.No, at the moment I would not recommend this distribution to anybody. Hopefully it will get better."

I learned to live with some difficulties, and changed many things to my needs. It is very safe and secure. This is no 'mainstream' distro, but if you go for it, it will make you more happy today than you were yesterday. I will keep it as long as possible. It is the perfect no-nonsens distro for me."

It turns out that they are quite slow. At the time of writing this review every RHEL rebuild project offers kernel 4.18.0-348.12 while VzLinux is sitll on 4.18.0-348.7 so they are effectively the slowest of the pack.Affter installing from ISO, there are 2 weird repositories called ""Started10"" and ""Started12"" enabled. All the repositories are merged into the virtuozzolinux-base repository.No support for secure boot.I don't think VzLinux is as good as the other options."

With GNOME being the most heavy DE, user-unfriendly and difficult to use, why do so many distros use it as either a default or a desktop environemnt use can install?I want my server to be easy on the weight, able to be customized somewhat with the look and feel and Some applications are a bit of versions behind, which doesn't make me feel comfortable using it because later versions of applications have newer bug fixes and the applications here feel stale and not as secure- which for a distro from Switzerland, being a private country with great privacy laws, it doesn't make sense to me why are things on this distro so far behind?I hope things will be more updated using this distro and having more choices for desktop environments.I give this a 5 out of 10.It's still from Switzerland, so that's why it gets the extra point of 5 instead of 4.I do look forward to seeing what will be coming though, so I am optimistic."

This ""distro"" is a preconfigured Debian. It does this excellently. Its true pitch is offering tweaks for what the average user would want in a way that survives a 'death of the author' situation. It is one of the friendliest distributions to install and use without terminal wizardry.Debian has its way of doing things so you should first assess the big points of Debian, which I summarize as an old, crusty, yet rock solid underlay that's not going anywhere. You will not be using cutting edge software - but then, Spiral offers usable flatpaks by default, an adequate solution for most people to get current software. For typical uses this is just about perfect. I recommend this as a peaceful answer for people looking for a setup that just works and who aren't concerned with the latest and greatest.Many desktops are offered, you'll want to look into their strengths and weaknesses if you aren't familiar. Be advised that the debian core makes these desktops a little obsolete compared to more 'hip' distros. However SL based on debian 12 offers a very solid version of KDE Plasma. Plasma and Cinnamon are my top picks for fully-featured desktops for windows migrants and general feature completeness. For weaker hardware: XFCE, Mate and LXQT can serve you better, the difference is largely taste. Look into the desktops before picking. But in rough order these are my choices if you are feeling option overload.Be advised that you may need to play with the first start boot option on newer hardware in case the normal boot option for installing does not play nicely. I've had this experience installing SL specifically on a more recent laptop."
3135,2023-07-12, SpiralLinux, 11.220925,8,2,"I guess that calling SpiralLinux a separate distro is a misconception. There is very little branding of SpiralLinux on its own, wherever you look - the Neofetch output, wallpapers, os-release, finally a GRUB entry - they indicate you are using Debian.There is nothing wrong with this fact - Debian is a rock solid GNU/Linux distribution and no wonder there are so many projects based on it.I'd prefer to call Spiral ""a set of tools and customisations around pure Debian"" or even ""Debian ready to be used by a normie"".In fact, the customisations made by the project's author are awesome. The software is stable and reliable, the default application selection is the most fitting for me, the resource usage is not very high and it doesn't stray far away from vanilla Debian.There's much to like, although - as I mentioned earlier - that's not enough to call it a separate distro, but rather a well-put and reliable Debian set."
3136,2023-06-02, SpiralLinux, 11.220925,9,3,"Works really well, i like it more than any other i have tried, like mint debian, regular debian, manjaro, and various archlinux systems, i'm done with arch, debian have everything i could ever need, i don't need 100s of updates every day, and the unstability that often comes there.I like the fact that snapshot are set up from the beginning, and that it's easy to install.Also that it's light and not filled with a bunch of unnecesary stuff, it's fairly clean and highly customizable.I run cinnamon on it, slightly customized for my liking. Great stuff! "
3137,2023-05-11, SpiralLinux, 11.220925,9,3,"Love this distro! It's light, fast, stable and has so many desktop environment options! I have very few criticisms other than the inclusion of some software and settings that weren't my finicky personal preference, selection of themes and wallpapers are a little sparse out of the box, and I think the default wallpaper is kinda ugly, but that's all minor nonsense. This is a really nice distro for both of my Lenovo Thinkpads after moving on from Peppermint. It is one of the few distros I've tried where the bluetooth support actually works reliably for me."
3138,2023-04-26, SpiralLinux, 11.220925,10,5,"Had been using Debian stable for years, then moved to Linux Mint Debian Edition after its last major release, as it seemed to offer a much more useful set of defaults for me. The Timeshift running indicator is probably my single favourite feature. However, the Cinnamon desktop environment, while it had many great features, just was not as responsive as XFCE for me.  This is what led me to trying Spiral Linux XFCE.Cons:— Screenshots on the site are not what I had once installed. That's purely an aesthetic issue, quickly tweaked.— No obvious update notifier as standard (have installed Package Update Indicator).— Spiral Linux definitely does not get enough love or attention, publicity wise.Pros:— Great selection of default apps.— Moving to testing or Sid is very straightforward thanks to the wiki.— Completely based on standard Debian repos, Spiral Linux can disappear tomorrow, and you have nothing to worry about.— Synaptic, and Gnome Software (Flatpak ready to go) is all there from the start.— AppImages work straight away, too.Overall great to be back on XFCE, the responsiveness is by far the best for me. Spiral has to offer the easiest way to get onto Debian without having to worry about long term support. Really impressed with what Spiral Linux have achieved."

Spiral has it. Do you need the latest version of specific packages? Flatpak is enabled by default. Are you interested in running Debian, but your hardware is a little too new? A newer kernel is installed.It comes with a ton of flavors. Out of curiosity, I tried running the KDE version on an old laptop of mine. This thing has 2 cores/threads and 4 gigs of RAM. To my surprise, the KDE version ran amazingly and didn't use too much RAM. There's no way I would get anywhere near that performance on Kubuntu or KDE Neon. Even Mint's XFCE edition was a little heavy for this machine.In a way, Spiral is like a combination of what Endeavour Os and Mint do. Endeavour gives you an easy way to install Arch with a ton of stuff an everyday user would want. Mint improves on the base of Ubuntu. I can see this becoming a very popular distribution in the coming years if the developer keeps it up. Get a team to implement tiling window managers, and a version without systemd, and you'll get a ton of internet personalities to giving this distribution more attention."

I wonder why this OS doesn't get more attention -- oh yeah I forgot because Arch and Fedora could give someone bleeding edge. Actually I installed it three times, the Cinnamon one twice but had to delete because I needed the disk for something else.One criticism about the Plasma edition is the developers should have saved the theme! It is lost permanently when one of the Breeze's is chosen. I only wanted to change the ""task manager"" color because I really dislike black which mismatches elsewhere in white background, and I resent the world increasingly being dominated by ""dark mode"" which isn't really better for middle-age sight. I hope soon the Spiral developers save the theme but with white bottom ""task manager"" panel, or somebody could re-create it. I liked that watermelon accent color, but better on Cinnamon. On both distros I installed Wine without any problems... although this is getting on a bit, would like at least v7.0.1 or something like that. I'm focused on music production, I don't play games and if I did, I'd like for those that could natively run on Linux. I was able also to use Ardour and Cardinal synth but don't plan to get carried away.The user should check the system settings for the keyboard, for his/her preferred behavior of the [CAPS-LOCK] key. Another trap on Cinnamon is for an user like me who makes heavy use of the touchpad. Must select (in ""Mouse"" section not ""Touchpad"") ""mouse emulation"" for buttons or it will drive you crazy!Almost forgot to say that on KDE version ""baloo"" could suddenly eat memory like crazy for some reason! Better to change KRunner settings to disable search categories that aren't needed. I also disabled the compositor. Yeah no shadow which sucks sometimes but it runs faster. The ""baloo"" thing never happened to me on Manjaro KDE and I also have NeptuneOS and Slackware 32-bit, also used Bluestar for a short time but didn't like its ugly olive green ""exclusive"" themes.I didn't need the language packs so I wouldn't be able to tell you about that. Also I have no need for three package managers, especially one of the buggiest aspects of KDE Plasma which is Discover. I uninstalled it. I like using ""apt"" on the terminal but have to struggle sometimes with slow Internet connection. Thanks very much Spiral developers for giving us a Debian-based thing that puts the original thing to shame and also other wanna-bes, especially that one without ""systemd"" and buggy with any kernel later than v5.10 or whichever outdated one they insisted on. At least Spiral could give the v6.0.0 kernel, no problems out of it so far. I'm sorry but I need at least one ""non-free"" and/or ""propietary"" thing and that is Wifi. Once I tried to install Debian just before Spiral KDE and it didn't even recognize Ethernet... what a mess.I advise a splash screen while it starts, it's unsettling seeing only the gear alone in a black background, also while it shuts down. With the theme the devs refused to save, after the username and password are given, it also goes into a totally black screen where eg. Ubuntu Studio shows off stupidly which turned me off straight away way back in late April.Again, great job by the developers of this distro.by mnrv-ovrf-year-c"

Install was easy but given that it defaults to the BTRFS file system be sure thats what you want, otherwise change it to EXT4.You get Firefox ESR, Thunderbird, VLC,Clementine and LibreOffice up front so that you are ready to go. Resource usage through Ksysguard was between 650-700mbs which is higher than Q4OS but lower than MX Linux. Codecs are installed by default, so theres no need to deal with it. My wifi and printers were auto detected without issue and I havent had any issues at all so far. Ethernet connection works fine as well and on one of my systems, Im running a Geforce GT 740 also with no issues. Discover software center has improved and I was able to find Kdiskmark, a great ssd bench test. I was also able to install Chrome by downloading it and using GDebi to install it.

To bring out a Linux-Distro with leaving the user without the option of admin-password...oh dear..."
3153,2022-10-07, SpiralLinux, 11.220925,10,5,"This is the distro I've been looking for. I'm using it on my Dell Optiplex 9020 1993 MHz quad core with 16 GB RAM.I use the Arc menu (found in the Gnome extensions with either the Raven (Alternative selection) menu or the Togneemenu, from the ""Modern"" menu choices. Tognee is actually mt favorite of the two, with a Budgie-style look, two columns,with the right-hand one featuring the categories. When a category is selected, its applications appear in a vertical list.I plan to use this as my daily driver. What I especially liked about this distro is the option to choose from among the offered desktops by clicking the ""Downloads"" button on the Spiral home page. Optionally, it can be downloaded from the link on the Distrowatch  announcement. This list of files will provide the size of the download and the link to the ISO file. My Gnome desktop download turned out to be 2.2 GB. I selected Gnome specifically for the many alternative menus available with the arc menu, which I have used in other distros. I would highly recommend Spiral for intermediate level users coming from Windows or just deciding to start with a fresh Linux distribution. I consider this a pretty big jump for recent Linux converts,and more of a lateral move for someone who has used Debian or Ubuntu. I have been hopping among distros for about 11 years and Spiral easily slides into my favorite Linux OS spot. Many other distributions are acceptable for daily useand this one is a particularly good fit for someone like me who prefers the Ubuntu/Debian family."

Also, the aesthetic is a bit retro or ugly. But the installation is simple, fast, and everything is in order to start working. Well done."

I've never been able to install pure Debian without many tweaks, add-on's, and adjustments. And it still often does not run the way I want. Spiral has no muss and fuss. Just install and go. It's light but powerful, and doesn't bog my computer down. I was skeptical when I first heard about Spiral and was reluctant to try it, because of a recent glut of disappointing distros. However, with Spiral I've been able to save two of my old laptops from the trash heap, reviving them to past glory. It's now the number one distro in my shop. My faith in Linux has now been restored. Thanks Spiral. "
3161,2022-09-21, SpiralLinux, 11.220628,9,3,"This distro is very nice, simple to use and quite polished. Spiral linux is a good as any distro out there right now. Being based on Debian and using exclusively Debian repo's is a great move. This distro is not burdened by too much software that will never be used and as a result is quite nimble much like bare debian. I have in the past used many different Distros, Debian based, ubuntu based and Arch based as well as Fedora so I am confident in my ability to judge quality. Debian based distros are what I run mostly(MX and Debian) and also Fedora(KDE). Stability is what I need and debian based has never disappointed me."
3162,2022-09-19, SpiralLinux, 11.220628,10,4,"At last! I'm an old hand at installing Linux distros and distro spins. I have been waiting a very long time to have a spin that actually requires hardly any fiddling and manuvering to be at home with. SpiralLinux is it! A most friendly Debian spin that should put a smile on many a face.So far I've only installed the KDE version. What I'd like to see is a Pantheon desktop knockoff that would include a global menu. By the way, everything did work right out of the box including the printer drivers, wifi, the better fonts and the multimedia codecs. So far I've installed a copy on a 2012 Mac-mini, a (bios modified) Acer chromebox, two older laptops and a Terryza mini. All run without a hitch."
3163,2022-09-19, SpiralLinux, 11.220628,9,5,"Spiral is based on an interesting concept - take the base Debian (11.5) and only make additions to it from the standard repositories to plug the well-known, obvious holes, hence implying that Spiral will be updated indefinitely even if the author is indisposed. It turns out that the author has form, as he also maintains Gecko which is a similar concept based on OpenSUSE, and this shows. I chose the Cinnamon spin, booted to it and then installed. The installation is straightforward using Calamares, and the major differences from vanilla Debian on restarting are:- btrfs filesystem with snapshots enabled and a graphical package, Snapper GUI, to manage them- wireless etc. drivers installed by default (from a vanilla Debian installation, I have no wireless)- a reasonable selection of basic applications- fonts and theming in place- the complex Debian language support replaced with a single application- flatpak already set up with a GNOME Software front end (which actually works, unlike too many GNOME Software incidences)- software and repository management using Synaptic, with the testing and unstable Debian branches a few checkboxes away.These seem modest but the first, in particular, is a huge improvement over almost any other Debian-based distribution - timeshift comes across as crude in comparison. And the second, or lack of a second, frequently confuses new users to the extent that Debian is considering dropping ""non-free"" installation media.I switched to testing with the few checkboxes implied as above and, now, have the latest and greatest software all round, with the safety net of a btrfs snapshot if that failed (it didn't).Overall, I give 9. The 1 is knocked off for the rather bland themes, wallpaper and icon set (faenza), although these can easily be replaced, and the use of Firefox ESR which is a bit artificial on Debian's part and, now, most simply superseded using the Mozilla flatpak.Recommended. Very nicely done and fast. I actually prefer Spiral to LMDE 5 because of the superb snapshot implementation.

Being a Windows User most of my life I looked for an alternative to switch away from MS and thier product policy. Linuxfx comes close, but unfortuantely not close enough to convert me. And here is why!1. Asking for a license for OSS and annoy me with messages all the time left pretty much the same impression that M$ left with me for the last decade. Asking for donations would be okay, and I would sponsor a project that has my attention. But this? Not a wise move or good marketing at all.2. Localization aka translating the UI and APPS into my native language isn't any good. My family, my friends and my customers are not fluent in English. If you want to convert Windows user to Linuxfx pay more attention to localization. 3. Application pre-selection is garbage. What is so hard to just install a basic operating system and let the user decide what applications s/he wants? Every freaking distro that I tested cluttered my system like Windows does and I have to remove the unneeded stuff myself in time consuming sessions.4. Too much of a choice is too much of a hassle. It takes time to manage it and no one has time today, especially when it comes to application selection. That's why M$ and (Gr)Apple are so successful. There are only two Office Suites, two mail clients, and so on that are used in the market. The rest is either used for exotic or historical reasons. The exception are browsers. But considering that they either have a Google or Mozilla engine we are almost there. The different UI's are just eye candy. So, limit the application selection to the most used ones for each category. 5. It must run on older machines! If it doesn't you will not convert anyone from Windows. Especially during high inflation times and sustainability discussions like today. One of the Linux community arguments is that it runs on older hardware. So, make it a habit and not just a ""marketing"" argument. Proof it!6. Make it simple to migrate. Look whats there and react on it. If Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird is installed on Windows, install it on Linuxfx as well and convert links and mails. Migration shouldn't be a pain in the backside. It should be as painless as possible. So, lower barriers and help them convert.These are my 2 cents as a Windows user looking for an affordable alternative to get things done hasslefree."
3165,2023-04-17, Linuxfx, 11.2.22.04.7,9,2,"Linuxfx was developed with in mind to mimic the look and feel of Windows 10/11. There are few, if any, operating systems quite like Linuxfx, also known as Windowsfx. It is this version of a Linux distribution, Windowsfx, that Windows users have been looking for. A Windows 11 interface with the speed and security of Linuxfx.Trusted and well-known software such as Edge browser, Teams, Skype, PowerShell and more are possible as standard. This is possible, among other things, because of the compatibility for .EXE and .MSI applications thanks to the well-known Wine. This makes the transition easier and more familiar, but the way is open for the deployment and use of the wide range of free Linux software. For example, LibreOffice, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Transmission, TeamViewer, Anydesk, Kodi, VLC, GIMP, Steam, Spotify, OBS Studio, etc. are included."
3166,2023-04-16, Linuxfx, 11.2.22.04.7,10,0,"One of the standout features of Linuxfx is its interface, which is modeled after the Windows 10 desktop environment. This makes it a great option for users who are familiar with Windows and are looking for a similar experience on Linux. Additionally, Linuxfx comes pre-installed with a variety of applications, including LibreOffice, GIMP, and VLC media player, making it a great option for productivity and multimedia tasks.Another positive aspect of Linuxfx is its ease of installation. The installation process is straightforward and doesn't require any technical knowledge, making it accessible to even the most novice users. Furthermore, Linuxfx has excellent compatibility with hardware, making it a great option for users with older or less powerful machines.However, one potential downside of Linuxfx is its limited software repository. While it comes pre-installed with a variety of useful applications, some users may find that it lacks the variety and depth of the software available on other Linux distributions. Additionally, while Linuxfx is designed to be user-friendly, it may not be as customizable as other Linux distributions, which may be a negative for more advanced users.Overall, my impression of Linuxfx is very positive. Its interface and ease of use make it a great option for users who are new to Linux, while its compatibility and performance make it a solid choice for more experienced users as well. If you're looking for a free and open-source operating system that is user-friendly and reliable, Linuxfx is definitely worth checking out."

After adding the necessary Microsoft support files, I was able to install MS Office 2007 Ultimate edition effortlessly. I was then able to install the Service Packs and some of the last update patches. I was only able to install some of the add-ins, however (not a big issue for me). So far, I am able to open Word and Excel (I haven't tried the others yet).Some things I dislike and find annoying include the following:1. Start Menu issue #1: I dislike the total absence of folders for each of the installed categories and programs, something I very much like with Linux Mint Cinnamon and Windows 7. Linuxfx has all of its program shortcut icons tossed together, which makes finding programs I am looking for difficult. At least they are sorted alphabetically.2. Start Menu issue #2: When I install system updates that require a system reboot, when I return to the start menu--all of my shortcut icons have disappeared! Eventually (but not now), it seems to correct itself.3. Linuxfx Store Software Center: I find this a poor substitute for the software and update utilities found in Ubuntu and Linux Mint. Anyone reading this should be able to make the comparisons to see what I mean.4. Software Repository: Where is it located? I have a non-functioning PPA that I cannot remove, which brings up an error message every time I perform updates using the Linuxfx update interface. All instructions I found via an internet search provide easy instructions for using the repository interface on Ubuntu and Linux Mint, which I cannot access to do anything on Linuxfx. On Ubuntu and Linux Mint, I can also pick and choose the fastest download locations by country, again something unavailable in Linuxfx.5. Printers: My primary home printer is an Epson XP-960. After configuration in System Settings, it failed to perform a Test Print.I am using the free version of Linuxfx as a trial run before deciding whether to puchase the paid pro version.

If the OS has a limited trialperiod, it should point this out up front so a user would know not to bother downloading if he/she expected to use it for more than the free period. That way a usercould spend time trying to hook another fish. Thebest part of this distro is the cinnamon desktop, andthe theme and backgrounds are pleasant. Whereels can you background be a Windows theme witha penguin glaring in the window. This is amusing, but I expectLinuxfx to either change both theme and alternate namevery soon or disappear and be revived by a renamedOS.For now, it just occupies a partition I can use or replacewith a Linux OS of equal or better quality.

However, distros like Linux Mint and Zorin OS do it much more effectively, by making it familiar whilst using their own designs. In the case of LinuxFX, they are prioritising cloning Windows' design over the general quality, so this causes an ""uncanny valley"" and it's just really jarring to use.But, they go one step further and include an activation key element. I mean, come on, they are trying to make elements of it proprietary? And they want me to part with $35 just to access the distro's proper features? Haha, good joke, you can keep your stupid distro.(Speaking of which they don't even have a proper payment system, you have to work out the currency yourself, it doesn't convert for you so you might end up paying extra (£35 or €35 instead of $35) and their email system doesn't even handle some countries?

Installed fine on my Mini PC desktop. Not exactly a mainstream release very much a specific focused release and a rolling one at that. Definitely notice the performance improvement aspects. Apparently it updates in the background but fails to ever notify of these updates. Gnome feels much like Fedora lot of similarities from an average user. App Store oddly list Chrome as a non stable release? Although Brave is also offered as well. Nice to see some commercial reals software being offered. Because it is not a mainstream release but more a cutting edge type rolling release I won't be sticking with it. I did like the install process and I had no issues with hardware detection.

3215,2023-03-21, Clear Linux, 37980,1,3,"I have a HP laptop which has an underpinning for Intel. I must say I love the concept of Clear.  It does optimize the system.  Normally a GNOME desktop would run 1.5- 2 GB of the RAM.  With Clear, the norm was 700-800 MB.  So, yes, there's a difference, Was rather snappy and quick.The reasons I gave the 1:There were problems installing.  Apparently it's not enough for certain responses to be set in the installer.  Even if the settings were ""pre-set"" and they're ok to remain in this way by the user, the user still needs to ""click"" on the response to indicate it's chosen.  If one doesn't, they will receive notice of a failed install. Also learned it's better to at least have a cleared hard drive prior to the install.  If one doesn't, this may also cause the install to fail.When there's automatic updates post-install the OS will not inform the user.  The only way to find out is through the terminal and attempt to install something, then one retrieves notice there's a lock in place due to the process being in use.After the update occurred, tried to reboot.  The system booted to a blank screen.  Which should not be happening with automatic updating. The forums were of no help and this issue couldn't be corrected.  This occurred twice when I installed it.  There is no excuse for this.I had tried Clear  I've used it before before. When all is in place it seems to be a good system which lives up to the hype about being optimized for Intel computers. it's one of the things I look for in a Linux.  (Opensuse Tumbleweed, which is what I'm not using, is another such system.)However, the programmers should at least make sure company-sanctioned updating for the system itself functions when they take place."

Quick enough to make me reconsider the Mac Mini M1 currently on the way.Pros:1. Quick, quick, quick!2. Very stable. Haven't seen anything go awry while I was figuring it out.3. System updates have been uneventful and quick (I guess based on how swupd package manager works).Cons:1. Software bundles are not flexible. It's often impossible to get a single package without installing an entire DE.2. Repo is miniscule and you will need to use Flatpaks (AUR is great but Clear Linux is worth losing it).3. Limited to a few DEs and WMs (see point 2). XFC, KDE Plasma, and a few others are available via their package manager.4. EFI only (it's Intel so not surprising).5. Nvidia drivers are a pain (luckily I don't buy Nvidia hardware on principle).6. ffmpeg is not included (there is a 3rd part repo that has it but still a work in progress). Flatpaks don't have this issue.7. It's inflexible and makes it hard to get the exact system you want (I used the server ISO and built the system I wanted).So why a 9 after the long list of Cons? It's a joy and a marvel to use. I can't believe how much performance other distros are leaving on the table. Intel clearly set out to demonstrate this and achieved it in spades.Other distros are going to need to copy Intel's secret sauce because the performance difference is too much to give up.

3235,2021-05-05, Netrunner, 21.01,9,10,"I'm not sure why this one is not more popular--much more popular. I was going to say it's as if Debian and Ubuntu mated and had a KDE child. But that is really more Kubuntu and KDE Neon. Netrunner is based on Debian and its own things.  Well I sat down and compared and contrasted Netrunner, Kubuntu, and KDE Neon. I love all three of them. I am rather foolhardily trying to do video and audio editing on some older NEC notebooks. I did add some RAM--one now has 4GB and the other 8GB. The machines are 8 years old and weren't top of the line when I bought them (they were really budget notebooks--but they had 15.6 inch screens and spacious keyboards, which is why I go them in the first place). I am actually quite gracious that various Linux distros have kept me using my aging hardware when Win 10 became out of the question (yes, I upgraded, no, it was not worth the bother).  I found one of the three 'out of the box' more ready to enable me to rip DVDs into web-ready video. I was able to install Handbrake and MakeMKV applications on all three, but Netrunner really worked best for me, despite it taking a bit longer to get the software installed. I give all three of these OSes 9/10 stars (which is about as high as I have ever gone). The 'twist' is that I hadn't expected Netrunner to hang with the other two. It sure did.     "
3236,2021-03-26, Netrunner, 21.01,9,0,"I love it.I don't have any fancy requirements as it's used mostly for some Python development and for that, it just rocks. It's fast, looks fantastic (to me), and is Debian-based so ticks all the right boxes as far as I'm concerned.It's currently my distro of choice, having replaced Ubuntu, and see no reason to move away from it, especially if it keeps improving.I give it a score 1 short of 10 as I have experienced a couple of minor stability issues, I should probably mention it's run as a VM guest in VMware.Mightily impressed, keep up the good work Devs!"
3237,2021-03-26, Netrunner, 21.01,10,1,Everything works out of the box.A very good distro.
3238,2021-03-02, Netrunner, 21.01,5,1,"Pros - * quick and smooth install * good eyecandy, being KDE * Debian backed repos, so lots of stable software * KDE comes with double-click, not single-click as installed default. YAY!!Cons - * absolutely no way to get 24-hr clock, a big Achilles Heel of all KDE distrosThis thing where you CAN NOT customise settings like the date time formats, ends the whole ""power"" DE thing. KDE as a whole is highly customisable, but then this. I have to turn to distros that have MATE or Cinnamon. If only the KDE upstream guys would fix this ONE thing, NetRunner would be a solid 9+ on the scale."
3239,2021-02-24, Netrunner, 21.01,6,1,Nicely customized Debian distro. Unfortunately still doesn't support full disk encryption on install or at least I couldn't figure it out. 
3240,2021-01-21, Netrunner, 20.01,5,0,"First, I'm going to focus on the pros so that I don't sound like an absolute jerk. First of all, Netrunner is very well put together. The themes and stylization are drop-dead gorgeous, and the inclusion of the App Dashboard instead of the Kickoff menu by default is genius. Package management with Apt is as expected, but there is a little delay with triggers at the end. App selection is great, too, if not the slightest bit bloated. however, the KDE plasma desktop is a little outdated, but that is to be expected from a Debian Stable base. Netrunner Core is nice, too. But now, let's tackle the elephant in the room: Driver support. Driver support and Codecs are literally the main focus of the distribution, they specifically state that NetRunner works out of the box. Then why, oh why, is it literally Impossible to install B43 drivers? Not including them out of the box is one thing, but No Driver manager to enable them after installation? I find it hilarious that a distribution designed for driver support falls flat in that exact category. Yes, I did run it on another laptop that DID have a supported wireless card, and it did run great, but no Broadcom support is inexcusable. 5/10"
3241,2021-01-21, Netrunner, 20.01,10,8,"Been running the CORE version for months. 0 issue. Beautiful, clean and extremely functional. This distro deserves to be in top 15 in my opinion. Netrunner Devs, if you are reading this: Great job!! Keep it up.

The main feature I still can't find in other desktop is fractional scaling. KDE has had a really functional, stable fractional scaling in Linux. And Kubuntu, without doubt, is one of the best Linux distribution with KDE. "

In comparing to other major distros(MX,Mint,Neon)it is a little on the heavy side, but being made for ex-windows user the devs want everything(apps and such) to be at the disposal of the user. One of my old laptops is slow so I opted for the very fast Q4OS and the Ubuntu based Quark OS which are very good distros as well. Linux is great, and filled with great distros for every taste and need, more stable and secure than windows. Made to run and get the job done."

So I tried Kubuntu and so far it's working well (rn it's my daily driver since I got no access to my PC).KDE Plasma is, alongside Cinnamon, one of my favorite Linux desktops to date. It's a bit heavy on the CPU, but the interface overall feels very streamlined and easy to navigate.

Maybe a patch will fix it, but there is one BUT, if Kubuntu is positioning itself as a stable system, why does it fail to work? Why does fedora KDE spin have no such problems.

Perhaps in the future this will be a non issues. Fingers crossed!!!Snaps aside, Kubuntu is very complete and easy. Unlike other KDE Plasma distributions, all the settings are right in System Settings (like Firewall, Driver Manager, Software Update) rather scattered elsewhere. There are no bundled distribution apps to make things ""easier"" (YaST for example). I'm of the mindset that if you have to include additional apps to manage your distribution, something is wrong.It would be super sweet to have a rolling edition of this. But honestly, 6 months is worth the wait to keep things running smooth.I really appreciate Ubuntu and KDE Plasma together. Like peanut-butter and jelly.

Why it continues to be the default for so many distributions is beyond me. Luckily, we usually have the freedom of choice for most.Snap packages and backend support is the first thing I purge with any distribution that has them. Followed by a full on block! Not only are the slow to load, they have issues with auto updating and audio. Push as they may, they will never exist on any desktop system of mine.No really much to say.

Q4OS and Neptune were very good but they were still on Plasma 5.20. Also, Neptune 7.5 seemed to boot way too slowly. Fedora's KDE experience was almost perfect except. It booted fast, looked clean, and had all the software I needed once I enabled everything for RPM Fusion and DNFDragora was not slow. However, upon an update, I lost some menu options and it was a lot of work to fix. Fedora is not a rolling release but it sure behaved like one for me. Finally tried Kubuntu and it was like Debian - nice and stable with all the benefits of Ubuntu but none of the drama or slow down. Snaps have improved and I only have the default handful of Snap apps like Firefox but everything else is either Ubuntu, Debian, or a Flatpak. Nice thing with Kubuntu, you can update every 6 months if you are willing to risk some stability for newer packages. Also, you can update the desktop to the latest version with Kubuntu's PPA. Very pleased with Kubuntu. I like Ubuntu-MATE too in the Ubuntu family but avoid Ubuntu-proper. Looking forward to Ubuntu-MATE's Debian-only version. I wonder if Kubuntu could do something like that? A Debian-only version of Kubuntu (like the old Mint Plasma)? I suppose MX Linux has that covered with their distribution. Anyway, MX Linux, Neptune OS, and especially Kubuntu were the Plasma-based distributions that finally made me appreciate KDE long-term. It took several years but I finally like Plasma."

3269,2022-10-27, Kubuntu, 22.04,9,1,"How to sum it up? Well, if you are willing to tweak some Ubuntu stuff ... like removing snap ... and some Kubuntu stuff ... like fine tuning KDE / Plasma you can have a great desktop experience; even 10/10. It is a 9/10 for ME, because I know how to tweak some stuff. IF you don't know howto tweak a Linux desktop you will end on a lower rating 8/10 or lower.So you can have a great experience if you have some basic Linux skills. I use it as my daily driver, Ubuntu with a KDE desktop is still the best combo for me. If you look at distro's, I recommend you try Kubuntu out and take the time to tweak it to your liking, you will not be disappointed and it may even end up as your top choice...  "

It allows me to have more updated kernel, kde, libreoffice than Debian and I suffer less from simple things like video thumbnails, which work out of the box in Kubuntu and not in Debian. I don't use a graphical interface or snap packages, just like in debian I use the console, .deb packages and some flatpaks and everything is running smooth and great so far."
3271,2022-09-24, Kubuntu, 22.04,10,62,"I have tried many distros over the last year which include Mint, MX Linux, Ubuntu, Manjaro, OpenSUSE, Fedora, ElementoryOS, PopOS, Peppermint, KDE Neon etc….but keep coming back to Kubuntu as, for me, it’s the most stable and uncluttered experience.Kubuntu has a 22.04 Ubuntu OS with a KDE desktop environment which I prefer, having a Ubuntu base OS just adds the polish which I just don’t seem to get from straight Debian, such as MX Linux, Ubuntu based OS’s just seem to be more refined.The applications which are deployed with Kubuntu are pretty much up to date but not necessarily bleeding edge, although with backports you can choose to update them.I don’t use the Snap store, removed firefox and re-added using Flatpak, so that is no issue for me.The installation detected all my hardware across multiple platforms, I have a Mac Pro Desktop (Late 2013) 12 core, Macbook Pro and a Lenova Thinkbook laptop, all worked flawlessly. OpenSUSE did not detect my broadcom wireless adapter on my Mac Pro, so I could’nt finish the install. MX Linux did strange things with my touchpad, both on the Macbook Pro and Lenova.Pros: Fast, Stable, Clean, Good support, hassle free installatio, excellent hardware supportCons: No specific Kubuntu developed apps, such as tools from MX LinuxI also really liked Linux Mint, KDE Neon and MX Linux but Kubuntu just had the edge with support and consistantcy. As my Linux knowledge grew I had a better understanding of what my important goals were, which were a distro with a firm maintenance team, ubuntu or debian based, stable and quick….Kubuntu was the best fit and I’ve been very happy with it for quite a few months now."

If they keep pushing this poorly thought out and implemented snap, I'll have to look for another distro. That's why I gave this low score. Otherwise I am satisfied with this distro."

Still less than a month ago I was an avid user of Linux Mint Cinnamon, but ever since I got a new laptop and 2.8k screen, I had to look elsewhere. Screen scaling didn't work for me at all. In fact, it was awful. Cinnamon was also really laggy with a higher res screen. This is where KDE shines. It looks great and works smooth. On top of that it's really stable. The only negative I have to say so far is that why didn't I try this earlier. Great distro. "
3275,2022-08-24, Kubuntu, 22.04,10,1,"On recent relases, I must say that from the Ubuntu flavours Kubuntu is by far the best overall, stable KDE experience and it is very responsive and quick system without using too much resources, even if you don't like snaps you easily do a minimal instalation and just deal with Firefox snap and nothing else, install flatpak and there you go you don't need to even touch snaps if you don't like them (aside from Firefox which you can ditch and reinstall it via flatpak)KDE has improved on recent years, a lot and in my experience so far Kubuntu is the only consistent across different devices I have tried, while true that you don't have the ""latest and greatest"" KDE versions I would trade it happily for stability on my main machine, also Ubuntu software compatibility is top notch in the Linux world and Kubuntu is not exception, even for gaming I got a little more FPS in some gamesSome people may be worried that main Ubuntu uses Wayland while Kubuntu decided to stay on X11, however I think that is for the moment a problem related to KDE itself and not Kubuntu as Manjaro KDE also doesn't have Wayland by default, I don't use an NVIDIA GPU but I'm aware that Wayland does have some issues with NVIDIA GPUs compared to Intel or AMDI love Kubuntu, it is my favourite Ubuntu flavour and I like that this release hasn't dissapointed me, if I had to give a small critisicm it would be that sometimes I have problems entering my password on Plasma Discover, but I also encountered this bug on Manjaro KDE so I don't know what could be, and didn't bother me that much"

Mais, à l'usage, la montagne d'application n'est pas toujours pratique, bien réalisée, quand on entre dans les détails. Je comprends qu'il y ait des fans. La question d'ergonomie du bureau est très personnelle. Point de vue personnel + élargi : cette ergonomie ne conviendra pas à tout le monde ! D'où ma note 8, oui c'est un gros travail, mais vous convient-elle ? Il n'y a pas d'absolu. A chaque fois que j'ai testé KDE (Kubuntu, Open Suse KDE...) je suis revenu à XFCE, Gnome ou Cinammon à cause de l'ergonomie de travail, les bulles, les groupements de document, qui rajoutent une complexité inutile à mes yeux. Je dis donc juste : si vous utilisez votre ordinateur pour travailler, testez un moment sans forcément tout remettre vos documents sauvegardés... KDE vous conviendra peut-être parfaitement (rajoutez +2 à la note) et d'autres enlèverons 3 points. Il n'y a pas d'absolu. "

The in-between releases, as opposed to long-term-support, I've never really tried: I prefer stability over latest-greatest.With reference to the previous comment: Manjaro and also Endeavour messed up my sound as well. Intensive research did not bring me any further. The solution (for me) was amazingly simple:change the Input & Output -Device to standard, instead of Headphone or whatever. This having been said arch based distros ain't my cup of tea no more: every six to 12 months an installation from scratch is required, because something broke which is more time consuming to fix than reinstall."

I've been using it mostly for video and image editing, and have zero issues.Previously used Manjaro KDE, and the update I did 3 weeks ago screwed up the sound driver, and I've tried so many things to try to solve it, and ended up crashing my computer. I had to recover it from TimeShift a few times, till I got so upset and pissed. I've been using Manjaro KDE for 3+ years without a problem, and before that, I was on Linux Mint 16, also with zero issues.I chose Kubuntu because I prefer KDE Plasma over every other DE, and I just want something that works. I guess LTS is better than rolling releases for what I do, and Ubuntu just released it on time for me to switch over from Manjaro, and I get 5 years of support from today.Cheers."

It has upgraded to newer packages yet is stable and working well. For example the newest kernel is 5.17 and libssl, for example, is on version 3.  Most distros are struggling to move past ssl 1.1 because software is not building against the newest libraries yet. Plasma is 5.24, which is latest as of now.  Probably the best hardware support of any distro out of the box. Amazing software selection.  Cutting edge yet a long term support release that will be supported for 3 more years.  The only major con for me is the Snap store being installed by default.  Firefox is only available as a snap. Canonical has decided not to provide it in the software channel.   I have removed all of that and get the Firefox binaries from Mozilla.Other than that, i have no complaints.  Great for beginner but just a great for advanced users that like to configure things the way they like.Easily deserves high scores."

Leaving room to use the system as you wish. It has also been very very stable ride for me and being ubuntu it has huge amount of supported software to use. In my opinion this is the best OS out of the ubuntu family. Being very usable with most any workflow, very customisable, and yet very resource friendly. Base Ubuntu is nice once you get used to it with GNOME but it hogs resources compared to KDE without giving that much benefits in return. Where as Lubuntu and Xubuntu run pretty much as light, but they feel vastly more clunky out of the box making the 100MB or so ram difference negligible.

Then things simply got better, and continue to do so with every new release.User hardware is the biggest challenge that can impact user experiences, and because of that there are always going to be user 'horror stories'.

All peripherals and phones work flawlessly with it. I also use the plus package to support the project. Robolinux has one advantage over large distributions.

I installed the basic version of each and bought the 12+ upgrade for Robo and the Pro version of Zorin, installed and set them up on 2 laptops. After trying both for a while, I set up my daughter's laptop with Zorin and let her try both it and Robo. We like both and have not yet made a final decision. Robo's commitment to security is great and it, with a VPN, seems to make a very secure system. I had a very difficult time with both distros insofar as the Linux ""world"" has a lot of programs available with weird names that I think could be improved by the simple addition of NNN ""Office Suite"" for example. Also, the entire Linux world has terminology and ways of doing things that all need to be learned. Having stated all that, I like both distros, with a leaning toward Robo for its security features. For me, as well as for a friend who is a long-time Linux user, I find the Robolinux 1-Click feature installation confusing because once in to it, I was faced with a lot of script files for installation that really confuse me; I would like to see this process made easier. However, once I figured some things out, I was able to install those I'm interested in quite smoothly. (In fairness to the Developer, John Martinson, I may very well still be doing some things wrong. Also, I'm undecided still about the approach of using a virtual machine to run Windows apps in their native environment versus using WINE and PlayOnLinux to install them. Both work. I do like John's provision of Windows versions for easy installation in VMs a lot. My daughter likes both distros and, like myself, favors Robolinux's security. It is important to note that our computer use is for education and business as well as personal, so the bottom line for us it that it works! I don't think that anyone can go wrong with Robolinux."

This is based on user experience only.A little over three years ago, I wanted to move away from using Windows. I chose one of the most popular distributions. However, I did not know how to install Virtualbox on it to use a few Windows programs. I asked for help from the forum, but I was told that the matter has already been answered elsewhere and it was hoped that I would first familiarize myself with the answers before asking the same question again.This made me look for another easier distribution and that's when I found information about Robolinux. It immediately proved to be reliable and stable. I could do everything I wanted. I got the Stealth VM program and it was really easy to install Windows through it. Shortly after this, the Plus package came and I decided to get it. Stealth VM was included in it. I felt that I had received programs that were necessary, but I didn't even know about them. I live in a country near which there is now a war going on. Even in my own country, banking systems have crashed from time to time. There are all kinds of hybrid effects all the time. I feel that the Robolinux software package has given me protection against all this. I would not have been able to install and configure those programs myself.Of course, I understand that skilled people know how to install everything they need themselves, but I have needed help with that and I have received it quickly from the developer.

All the peripherals and phones I own work flawlessly. In my opinion, Robolinux is very suitable for a person who wants to switch from Windows to Linux but does not yet have enough skills to use it or does not have the time to learn it. Robolinux is focused on information security. The Plus package is a good example of this. It's great that .Librewulf is now selected as the browser. Security and stability is also provided by the fact that Robolinux now has long-term support. I myself have been completely satisfied with this. I do understand the criticism of those who criticize its cost. But not everyone is an IT professional, so it's good to have this kind of support. In addition, it gives the developer the opportunity to develop it further."
3303,2022-09-23, Robolinux, 12.07,3,1,"I wanted to try this distribution after seeing a good review about it on the internet. With the last update, I lost everything from the second hard drive. The hard drive is a brand new Seagate 1tb. I have used it as a backup disk. I don't dare to use this distribution anymore. Maybe the hyprid kernel has not been tested  enough on computers. I was able to recover files with Photorec, but this has been a lot of work. I wish the developer would provide more information about the Plus package. Now there is nothing other information than what the developer himself says when promoting them. Elsewhere, e.g. I have read on the Mint forum that the Robo Untracker program is just a script for the Macchanger program. Likewise, the developer finances with the free Virtualbox program. This distribution leaves so many questions open that I don't want to use it. As already mentioned in the previous review, this distribution starts slowly for me compared to other Ubuntu-based distributions. I'm also afraid that this distribution is spying."
3304,2022-08-29, Robolinux, 12.07,3,28,"Some reviewers value this distro by 10 or so, while others do so by 1.They are so different.  I am rather a member of the latter group.These are some of my reasons :1. This distro seems like a poor version of Linux Mint.  For example, themes given are so feu and shabby.2. They say that by this distro you can easily handle windows on Virtualbox. But to do so you have to pay.     By using wine program or genuine VirtualBox you can use Windows applications so-so without paying. It is free.3. On desktop always settles an icon of the link to a site advertising ""useful"" devices to add to this distro.     They are not free.  I don't know how to remove this weird icon.4.  Start-up is very slow even when you use a SSD. (This is my case. I compare the time with that of my other distros.)       I am afraid that the distro may be ""spying"" my PC by so late start-up.5. When I tried live install by the latest Mate verson (12.07) (twice), may-be by some bugs I cound not complete installation.     So I had to use the version 12.06. "
3305,2022-07-28, Robolinux, 12.06,10,60,"What's not to love about Robolinux? It's light, fast, and boots up in seconds. Yet it's fully featured like a modern distro and is able to run all the new work from home programs I need like office suites, Zoom, and Skype. I think its perfect for new and old computers alike. I'm running it on my 8 year old Fujitsu laptop, and see no need to buy a new computer anytime soon. Pros: - easy install - multiple DE options - lts version- hyprid kernel- helpful online guides - many, many useful custom tools - customization - lightweight - rock solid, rarely have had problems with any of the Robolinux versions - works well on new and old  laptops Cons: - no real complaints"
3306,2022-07-04, Robolinux, 12.06,10,36,"Wonderful Linux distribution; it's most certainly true to its word; it's fast, lightweight, and efficient.Great job works really nice easy install drivers work,its not bloated you get the chance to install what you like fast distro, I have  always liked Robolinux  personally I can't see any cons. This is one of the distros that truly do 'JUST WORK'. I especially appreciate that it has now become a rolling version. This distribution is very stable in daily use and I haven't noticed any bugs and it hasn't crashed once."
3307,2022-06-09, Robolinux, 12.06,10,35,"As Robolinux user I especially appreciate now that it has become an LTS version. The kernel is hypride (based various Ubuntu source code). In our housing association, an internet service provider changed. The connection did not work with the earlier  Robolinux version, but with the new one it worked immediately. I was also able to install an old Epson Perfection Scanner that no longer has drivers. It was identified as a newer scanner, but now it works. Robolinux is reliable, stable and fast. I can do the all the work of a small office and install the latest programs. "
3308,2022-06-07, Robolinux, 12.06,10,39,"I got a job a month ago to find a suitable linux distribution for our small office (less than 10 people). Here are the reasons why we chose Robolinux. First, it is based on Ubuntu. It never crashed during the test period. All smartphones, scanners, printers and the wireless network worked instantly or were easy to install afterwards. Windows integration has worked well with Robolinux. Distribution starts quickly and worked well on all workstations. The distribution has been pleasing to the eye it has been comfortable to use. Robolinux has been stable. An added benefit has been the plus package as well as the ability to use telephone support and remote support in problem situations. This has been a great benefit, especially for a small office when you can’t afford to hire an IT person for support. Robolinux is very scalable. I highly recommend it."
3309,2022-06-07, Robolinux, 12.06,10,33,"Rock solid, elegant and stable. This for me is my everyday distro. For years ive been distro jumping but finally I found the distro that covers all my needs, a balance between good looks and good performance, easy for beginners, intuitive.Robolinux perfectly fits my needs in productivity. Although is lightweight, is a complete and serious linux OS. Totally recommended.Everything just works and it is easily customizable.I had a problem installing a program. I asked the developer for it and got an answer within an hour. Thanks for that."
3310,2022-06-06, Robolinux, 12.06,10,24,"I was a Windows user and I wanted to ""try"" Linux. I don't want know anything about it-jargon, I don't want to write ancient Greek (sudo--abr--ka--dabra). I don't want to know anything about any codes, syntaxes or that kind of things.I accidentally downloaded Robolinux. And there is no return. Absolutely fantastic. Stable, fast, a workhorse, care free, great for a first timer. I don't even think about ""Windows"", ""Linux"", ""Operating System"". I just open my laptop and use it.It looks nice, very fast and stable. "
3311,2022-04-26, Robolinux, 12.04,1,0,An Ubuntu-based distribution that funds with the plus package. This package contains the developer's own scripts from programs made by others. It’s really unfortunate that this is still being sold as a New Year’s offer. It would be good if the developer said things openly and directly. Now everything is so disguised and based only on advertising.I believe that the popularity of this distribution would increase if transparency increased. Plus package programs and their operation should be shown in screenshots or video how they work.
3312,2022-03-24, Robolinux, 12.04,10,25,"I posted a negative review of this distribution last month. The developer made a good-faith effort to resolve our differences, and I'm satisfied that there was a misunderstanding. It is very difficult for one person to keep a distribution going, and mistakes can be made.I did find the distribution easy to install, and it appears to be rock solid. One thing I enjoy about it is that flatpak packages work very well on it.I had previously posted a retraction, but apparently it didn't make it past moderation. Hopefully this one will.Make sure you get the latest version (see the review of 2022-1-17 by someone else below). When I downloaded it I did not get the version based on Ubuntu 21.10, but rather that based on Ubuntu 20.04, despite the fact I downloaded it later than that reviewer. That's the one I'm sticking with, as it isn't giving me grief. "
3313,2022-02-28, Robolinux, 12.03,1,0,"I just had an extremely negative experience with this distribution.I bought the upgrade package, which included 11 upgrades which only brought me to 12.11.The current version is 12.12.Not only did not I not get the upgrade, the developer had the gall to dun me for another $25.00 to upgrade again - four days after I bought the upgrade.Your mileage may vary, but personally I'm going to take some action to stop this.I'm not a very big fan of deceptive advertising. I should have known better."
3314,2022-02-26, Robolinux, 12.03,10,36,"I found this distribution while looking for a lightweight Linux to install on an old Dell with an i7-3770 and 16GB of DDR3. I was intrigued by the Stealth VM offered, so I downloaded it and installed. The install was utterly painless. All my hardware was recognized, no exceptions.That was enough for me to shell out for the upgrade, which I don't regret in the least.I was a bit surprised to find the version installed to be 12.01 instead of 12.03, but there is an option to ""Auto Upgrade"" which works amazingly well. I sequentially installed upgrades to 12.11, where I am now. Anyone who has felt the pain of stock Ubuntu doing bizarre things to your system when upgrading will really, really appreciate how easy it is to upgrade Robolinux.When installing Windows in the VirtualBox VM, remember to install the guest additions in your Windows (download it, load it into the virtual optical disk, and once in Windows install the additions from there). I didn't remember to do that, and emailed support. I got an answer back in minutes - no kidding. Best support for Linux I've experienced since SUSE in the late 90s. The distro deserves a 10 for that alone!The Windows 10 Pro I installed runs like a scalded ape on Robolinux. I allotted 8GB of RAM to it and left 8GB for the host. So far it works absolutely great.This distribution is certainly worth a try if you have older hardware. One caveat: I installed this on the entire hard drive on my computer, so I have no experience with partitioning for dual boot on installation."

3316,2022-01-13, Robolinux, 12.12,10,33,"As usual, easy to install, easy to use ! Good job.If you are looking for a distro that lets you just use your computer for the work you intend for it, and if you are looking for a distro that just has practically no issues with installation and updating workflow, then this is the distro for you.  Great linux distro if you are looking for a system where you install and just use without having any issues with the distro itself. The only positive problem is the choice of desktop. They all work fast and are good looking."
3317,2022-01-12, Robolinux, 12.12,10,25,"I once found this when the development of BellaOS was stopped and I have not regretted my choice. Robolinux xfce has been reliable and stable. It is easy to configure to your liking (dark pro, plank, desktop bar etc.). Stealth VM is really good and secure. I still use Photoshop CS4, which I bought twelve years ago, with no problems. Robolinux Plus includes many security-related programs that make daily use more secure. I have never caused Robolinux to crash. Therefore, it is definitely my distribution. "

Nothing but good things to say about this release - running stably without crashes for me, performing well on low-end equipment, low memory footprint, everything works right out of the box. Very easy to use. The true alternative to Windows. It installs very easy and fast. It has everything you need and more. "
3325,2021-12-14, Robolinux, 12.12,10,44,"Highly recommended distro, underrated for sure, but this will change.  This distro is great! I should have checked it earlier.  I’ve tried lot of distros because of I wanted something simple, easy to handle, nice looking and that everything works out of the box. Robolinux is perfect for that, fast to boot and stable. Installed on HP laptop, smooth and quick. No issues, has everything I need. Hopefully good quality will be maintained in future versions."
3326,2021-12-10, Robolinux, 12.12,9,43,"At the request of a friend, I decided to try Robolinux. After using Ubuntu Mate for a long time, I decided to choose the mate version. The installation went smoothly. Robolinux started and updated quickly. The desktop and menus are good and clear. Colors, fonts, brightness and contrast are pleasing. All the necessary programs are easy to install afterwards. The developer sells 12+ additional packages and also phone support. This can be a good solution for beginners as well as small businesses especially nowadays when there are all kinds of limitations. Overall, this distribution left a positive impression. Everything I have tried has worked and no crashes have occurred. I don't know yet if I'm going to use distribution permanently, but I'll leave it to my laptop for now."
3327,2021-12-09, Robolinux, 12.12,10,26,"Installed Robolinux last summer (ver 12.08)   After hopping to other distro i came back to it. It surprises me again. Every feature works as it should. It’s easy install, boots fast. Looks good, not old. All apps a few clicks away.  After all updates and version upgrades all have worked fine. There have been no bugs and the computer has not crashed. I have received  quick advice via email twice in a couple of years from the developer. I like this and I don’t feel the need to change the distribution because everything works. I recommend this."

Very stable, and surprisingly lightweight for a full featured desktop (cinnamon). Good start for a beginner with additional packages. I've had a number of favorite Linux distos over the years and Robolinux is one of another one.  A clean, fast, stable, ease of use, distro to easily switch Windows."
3329,2021-12-08, Robolinux, 12.12,10,24,I must say after trying many distros over the last 12 years I really like Robolinux 12.12 the best as it is totally free to download and it is not bloated. If I want to pay for their add on software that is totally up to me. I sent a few questions to the Developer and he answered my questions quickly and accurately so now it is just smooth sailing. I also really like the new icons and how fast Robolinux boots up and shuts down. All in all I can recommend this Distro to all of my friends. Thank you Robolinux for all you do!
3330,2021-12-03, Robolinux, 12.11,1,0,"A questionable distro with odd intentions. Tbh, looking on the website makes me uncomfortable because of so many religious references. The distro itself is pretty resource intensive and slow, the virtual C drive thing is just a script for virtualbox, the privacy features are touted, but don’t even work and doesn’t seem to be doing anything underlying except just being a application to fill up space. The developer pushes for donations when his “work” is basically taken from other distros and passed off as his own. That’s very shady and I can’t support this at all.Find a better, faster and more stable distro like Linux Mint."
3331,2021-11-14, Robolinux, 12.11,5,0,This distribution leaves many questions open. If the Stealth VM is just a VM script then is Fastboot an autoclean/clean script? Backdoor security maybe chkrootkit/rkhunter script and Untracker only macchanger script. I hope that the Developer will give more information about them even in the form of screenshots. What is the added benefit over free programs if you pay for the developer's own programs annual?  
3332,2021-11-14, Robolinux, 12.11,1,0,"This distro has been a bit questionable over the years, especially when Windows XP support was ending and the developer put a program in where you can convert your XP machine to a virtual C drive, and Windows 7 too, but where the developer said basically it was his own creation, underlying code shows it’s just Virtualbox with some scripts run. The misleading mess there and asking for support while still keeping headstrong the the developer did everything for the virtual C drive really made me question using RoboLinux anymore. It’s an ethics thing and it is concerning for it to be ok with a developer of a distro.I would not recommend this distro, basically, you can get everything on this distro from another one that doesn’t lie to you while asking for support  I tried contacting the developer who’s email is of course on the website, but he hasn’t responded to any of my questions."

I think this is the best one of all Robolinux versions (cinnamon, mate).  I have tied  them all.  I hope that the users will try it more.  Only the basic package is installed, but all the necessary programs are easy to install afterwards.  I recommend this."
3334,2021-09-03, Robolinux, 12.10,10,64,"Ive been using Robolinux for a few years now and i love it. It has been my favorite linux version out of the 20+ flavors that ive tried over the years. I am not a hardcore linux geek but have put much effort into migrating all my devices away from microsoft, googl, ect. Robolinux has played a huge role in that transition and the developer knows his stuff and has been very helpful the few times i have made contact with him. its a shame that the opensource community is too concerned about getting all software for free and tend to overlook the fact that a workman is worthy of his hire! I think that if people were willing to financially support a project like Robolinux then it would be in the top 10 on DW, So far over the past few years i have not had any issues with the the distribution and it does very well for me. Since its first use on my machine, i have installed Robolinux on all my pcs and I have also supported the project here and there when i can, since it has replaced Windows for me which was a huge stepping stone and worth a few bucks in my opinion. Anyone wanting to migrate out of windows would thoroughly appreciate Robolinux and if any linux-snob gave it the time of day i think that a very fair percentage of them might make the switch. I am not affiliated with Robolinux in anyway besides using it as my go-to OS, i am very pleased with it compared to the 20+ flavors i have tried over the past 10 years, i am no linux pro nor am i a novice, i play with code here and there and im not a code junkie, but i am no tech-dummy and my opinion is not entirely laymen and has very much time and energy invested into finding what works best for me: Robolinux is just that."
3335,2021-09-02, Robolinux, 12.10,8,0,"I have been using Robolinux for years as a second or third distribution because of it’s excellent distro for low end hardware. Based on ubuntu. Stable and fast. Boot time 4 to 5 seconds. Shutdown same 4 to 5 seconds. No crashes. No freezing. No problems. I originally started using this because of the Stealth VM program. The development of this distribution and also its use has been hampered by the fact that the developer has always so eager wanted to make money with it. Either as donations or by selling programs. You never know what will come next and prices will vary. Maybe it’s time to say goodbye to this and move on to using Mx Linux, Mint, Zorin, Debian, etc. I’ll give ten of the distribution itself but only six of its development.  I am so sorry that the developer himself has caused problems for the distribution process."
3336,2021-09-02, Robolinux, 12.10,10,0,"I noticed a notification about this distribution in DW's Latest Distributions section and decided to give it a try (the mate version). I was pleasantly surprised. The distribution is fully functional, fast and pretty good looking. The wireless, scanner and printer work instantly. There are quite a few programs pre-installed in the distribution, but they are easy to install afterwards (Gimp, Libreoffice, Thunderbird, etc.). This left a very good taste. A slightly different taste comes from the 12+ package advertised by the developer. It is chargeable and quite expensive. There is no more information about the programs on the website, for example in the form of screenshots. That way you should buy the add-on a bit like a pig in a sack. The developer advertises that 12+ is very popular but I haven't found any more information about it. But the basic distribution leaves a very positive picture. It is done professionally. The amount of time I’ve already been in the linux world has been that I know users rarely pay for anything. If a developer finds another solution to this then I think the popularity of Robolinux could grow significantly. So good is Robolinux as a distribution."
3337,2021-08-28, Robolinux, 12.10,10,31,"One f the best distros out there, it doesn't have much name but it's as good as another that they're considered the best. A little more publicity and it will definitely raise up ranking. I didn't get the additional 12+ package. I think it can be a good solution for those who do not actually know how to install and use security programs."
3338,2021-08-26, Robolinux, 12.09,10,29,"Beautiful environment, good responsibility, no issues.Overall I'm happy with this distro . It seems to me as quite solid and is my distro of choice.I have it working well on a variety of different machines including some very old and some fairly recent ones.  Installed this on my 10 year old PC. Everything I needed worked with no problems (browsing, office, music/videos)."
3339,2021-08-18, Robolinux, 12.09,8,0,"I have been using this on my multimedia computer for TV recordings without any problems for a long time. I haven't bothered to update it. I thought yesterday to put the latest version on it and noticed that in order to download it you need to first register. After then will get a link to the download page. Why, I don't understand. Fortunately, it can also be downloaded through Sourceforce. I also wonder that the Robolinux website first announces a mobile phone with Robolinux. It's very expensive. The installation of Robolinux went smoothly. There have been no problems in use. It's just a typical Ubuntu variation. Startup is very fast. The user is also attracted with the 12+ package. It includes the developer's own programs. They are programs related to startup time and security. I think these are really overpriced. And they cannot be tested for a trial period. I think the development of Robolinux has now gone in a direction that I no longer like. A better solution would be to create a completely cheaper paid version if the developer is looking to receive donations or income. I will still give a rating of eight but I hope the developer will start thinking in which direction it will take this distribution. Now its ranking has gone down. However, I leave the distribution on the computer and start monitoring what happens in the development of this. "

I really like the Deepin system and have been using it for daily work for 3 years. I plan to continue using it in the future. The biggest advantage of this system is that it has a well-established store that can support commonly used apps for daily work and use. It is also very friendly to Xiaobai. The system is still in continuous development, and there are many areas that can improve optimization, such as the customizability of the desktop (which seems to be its advantage because it is relatively simple and concise). Then there is still room for improvement in the smoothness of the system desktop, and I hope the development team can work hard to improve it."

Having no option to change the date format presented on the taskbar screen (eq. DD/MM/YYYY).2 - At login, when it has facial recognition, the system informs you that the face should be on the screen, but the image of the camera and the screen is not shownHave a nice day!"

I'm running Deeping on an old laptop equiped with i73630QM + 16gb RAM. The system runs smoothly, besides some minors bugs on the interface, but this is ok since its a beta version. Before Deepin, I was using PopOS, that feels a little more stable, but lacks natively some UI Features like Dock transparency, the possibility to choose between more than one icon, cursos and theme packages, and also the window minimize Effect that can be adjusted to look like MacOS Magic Lamp Effect.

Extensions cannot be loaded or installed. Kdenlive video software is also not present in the repository and impossible to install as snap or flatpak, I think it's chinese political restrictions.

3348,2023-04-29, deepin, 20.8,6,4,"Reviewing version 20.9.Let me start this off by saying, I'm not gonna get into the politics around ownership or any of the usual concerns around deepin aside from that they need to fix the EULA, it's illegal to forbid modification while using the GPL, but whatever. It's unlikely any legal trouble will ensue outside of China, or even inside it if the stories about copyright there are to be believed. Regardless, read the EULA and privacy policy carefully and decide if it works for you.Out of the box, I will admit it is very pretty, so pretty in fact that putting it on white hardware may stop your loved ones from buying an Apple computer. While pretty it's very basic in window management; translations are mostly good but there is Sinicized English here and there. Some package notes and settings are still in Chinese. The browser defaults to Baidu search but in all programs both Chinese and western services are available.The hardware needs are a tad overstated, it ran fine on an aging HP laptop with 16gb ram, integrated graphics and an SSD. I think having an SSD is the most important thing. I did not run into any issues with choppiness of animations, either.Aside from that, this one is aimed at uber casuals, which makes sense as the DE is obviously inspired by MacOS, but is not for me or probably for you if you're reading DistroWatch. I say that because it almost expects you to use pre-installed programs and while they're pretty, they're basic, very GNOME-like. The file manager in particular is very reminiscent of Nautilus. The reason I say it expects you to use pack-in programs because the software available is hideously out of date, and this is someone who is writing this review from a Debian Bullseye desktop. Even Flatpak has issues due to its age and cannot launch many apps. It also can be temperamental with launching alternative terminal emulators due to the way it just closes to tray.That being said, the complaint of running non-deepin apps ruining the look is only half true, if you use Qt apps the theming is consistent although the corners usually aren't rounded.Unfortunately, DDE seems to have issues running outside of deepin, UbuntuDDE doesn't display rounded corners correctly ruining the whole look. I haven't tried it on Arch, though."

Recently, I was going to install Deepin 23-alpha2. The look is great. However, as soon as I had the installer in front of me, I soon realized thatthe option to format/not format was gone! You must format all the partitions for the installation.That is unacceptable. The user should always have all the control over the installation process,types of file systems, format/not format etc. Thus, I cancelled the installation and I will not try againuntil this has been solved. If you have a separate /home partition, you can replace the OS by another and just mount the /home again, without formatting it. The user then only needs to format/ and /boot (UEFI system). This is in my opinion, a serious ""flaw"". The freedom of the user isalways the most important factor here. Than you anyway. "

Elegant looking of DDE is as the expense of memories, causing really slow respond. The really big round window corner takes too much space in a small screen. Perhaps it will perform better in some new and big-screen devices.Deepin 20 is still based on debian 10 - the oldstable version, which is unbearable because it brings outdated packages in base environment, though deepin has software packages is app store apt source and seems to set them apart."

Also is very important to point that there are e excelent community behind or in front of deepin. I can specially talk about the community Deepin en español wihich the members always are helping to others as soon as possible to solve anything related to deepin.Also, I like that the system each time is trying to improve the user experience adding or improving apps. I have using the distro since the version 15 and its noticeable that the team behind the distro makes a big effort to be vanguard updating its design, even though the concept always its the same: a minimalist os, friendly and beautiful ui design.I would like the system to be a little more fluent and uses wayland by default.And the future for deepin looks pretty good with its own dependency management system linglong, atomic updates, the new concept to design apps called flow design which we can already see in the new apps in the new version deepin 23 alpha, also its own programming language."

The installer is simple to use but stillprovides all the options needed, like ""automatic"" vs. manual installation, choosing different file systems,  mount points etc. Thus, I would rate the installer 10/10.The installation itself went smooth. All applications work as expected. The GUI is well very well done, good looking icons, the desktop is fast and easy to adjust to the user´s need. For those who may not like the look of LibreOffice, there is an easy solution: simplyinstall the package ""libreoffice-gtk3"" and the problem has been solved. After running ""spectre-meltdown-checker"" everything is on ""green"", and thusno obvious security risk [no red]. I installed kernel 5.10.36-amd64 and 5.10.101-amd64. Bothwork great. The use of Debian,  as a rock solid foundation, and Deepin user interface, makes a perfect combination. Thank you Deepin team.

3361,2022-06-22, deepin, 20.6,4,11,"Deepin, a distro that I have been using for the last few months is really aesthetically pleasing and powerful. Which based on Ubuntu, gave it the ability to handle .deb packages and have rock solid community support. It's app store and support of android apps is very good. However, I must say that Deepin would override your computer entirely. Which is seen when my hard disk got corrupted as Deepin tried to make copies of itself there. Privacy is also a very large threat, even though they have said that they have removed all the trackers and stuff, the community would still be weary. Deepin is also rather heavy on RAM, which it averages at around 2 Gibs, compared to Fedora (1.2Gibs) and Arch (600Mibs), it is more suitable for people who have at least 16 gigabytes of RAM. All in all, Deepin is a very good operating system for people who want their desktop to be aesthetically pleasing, however, for power users and normal users that just would like to get things done, Deepin is not the best option."

3363,2022-06-05, deepin, 20.6,8,1,"This is a very well presented, rock solid and very visually pleasing version of Linux. The developers have extended commonly used apps to add features to enhance them, not just visually but practically. An example of this is the screen capture tool which incorporates an OCR feature allowing text to be saved from a screen shot.  Deepin is a perfect Linux version for those wanting to undertake day to day computer tasks. I have installed it on my laptop so I can take it to meetings to read minutes and reports, and for note taking during the meeting. I have even recorded meetings with the Deepin  Voice Note app.  I've installed Deepin v.20 on an 82 year old's laptop as well as 60 year old's. They are both very happy with it because its desktop is intuitive, looks polished  and just works for their needs.The downside for me is the dated Debian base. I use another distro on my work machine because I find Deepin's software is often way behind where other distros are at. Deepin choose to build their desktop on a dated but tried and true version of Debian. They do this because it gives the user a very stable rock solid experience.  For ""power users"" however (and I'm not talking about being a gamer here), it can be frustrating to find the latest .deb packages won't install because of backward capability issues. It would be a good move for Deepin to return back to an Ubuntu based option for those needing a cutting edge alternative to their conservative Debian base.

Some got stuck at the installer, some wouldn't boot up at all, some would not even detect the Ethernet of my ASUs Prime B560 motherboard. Some just gave me one good display with the 1920 x 1080 resolution while the second display was just garbage showed.I know that searching for proper driver from internet and upgrading the Linux kernel probably can solve some of the issues( but still not sure). I do not want to do it for every Linux version, because I change Linux versions rather frequently.The software installer( for adding software) is exceptionally good that some extensions to the Firefox and installing a zipped package can be done by clicking a ""Install"" button when needed. This is something that I have not experienced with other Linux versions.Need not to say, Deepin is as elegance as usual and easy to install and use.Really appreciate this Deepin 20.6 that allows installation without issue or additional work for my 11th generation Intel CPU machine after waiting one whole year for a good Linux version release.Still need to try Deepin later for a setup of dual monitor plus a 4K TV later.

3368,2022-05-25, deepin, 20.5,10,15,Superb. To be honest the look of Deepin doesn't actually appeal to me that much. But I took Deepin for another spin today on bare metal. I was blown away how far the distro has come. Didn't encounter a single bug and there are lot of small usability enhancements which I hadn't seen in Linux before.In the past I couldn't get flatpaks to work but this time all flatpak apps I tested worked without any issue. Its clear the devs are serious about creating a mainstream alternative to Windows.To me the next step for this project would be independence from Debian because some of the base packages tend to get really old. Ideal would be a semi-rolling approach similar to Fedora.
3369,2022-05-15, deepin, 20.5,10,12,"Very good, excellent distro. The best of. Not for nothing do many users describe Deepin as ""the most beautiful Linux in the world"", the user interface is minimalist, clear and user-friendly. Thanks to the launcher, which contains all the applications, and the taskbar, which takes the best of Windows and macOS, it is possible to navigate the system very quickly. However, the graphic impression is very individual and what some users may like, others may be damned. The main panel no longer parks at the edge of the window, but gives the impression of a floating object. This impressive effect was copied from macOS11, much like the rounded corners that Microsoft works on in many parts of Windows. In Deepin you will find many transparent elements and restored animations. There is also an integrated multitasking view that displays all open windows and virtual desktops with a single click. Light and dark modes are standard, and users can set the color temperature. For the new Windows 11, Microsoft has made some design changes. This may not be to everyone's liking, plus the system requirements for installation and use are high. If you want to try a sleek alternative system and don't want to spend a lot of money on a Mac, it's worth exploring Linux Deepin. The distribution is based on Debian and is being developed in China. At first glance, it convinces with its elegant interface and customized tools."

3372,2022-04-07, deepin, 20.5,8,49,"I like it.  It has its own unique to me desktop interface that sort of baffled to begin with but became more intuitive with use.It's default apps can arrive with Chinese as the default language, for example Thunderbird 91.7.0 And for a while I had that version and a downloaded version running by Terminal ./Downloads/thunderbird/thunderbird  As a relatively new user to linux I loved the problem solving as part of the experience.Let's face it - the rest of the world had to strive to adapt to software mostly in English so having the challenge another way round seemed reasonable.  Thinngs like GtkHash, Gparted, ... are NOT available in the standard install and when I failed to comply with Terminal password efficiencies on SUDO I was informed in Terminal that I will be reported for doing what I did.This seems to suggest it is aimed for junior, mid and highschool levels in education system as well as for home users.Would I use it for my kids in school age?  Heck yes!I awarded 9 points as I believe it is well suited to safe use in academic environments for shildren and young adults.It is not an all bells & whistles distro - but to be fair I don't think it was ever intended to be.LibreOffice comes as a standard at variant 7.0.4.2 and its GUI looks dated in Deepin's own desktop gui  - it is very fast and the small text is very easy to read.The support materials do appear to arrive in a mixture of Chinese and English so I guess there is still a lot of work to do on the product."

3379,2022-02-28, deepin, 20.4,9,3,I wanted to give a 10 but I had 2 minor issues:-System froze once as I activated my Bluetooth speaker as music was playing in their default music player. It happens randomly since I was unable to repeat the crash-Skype insider when set to auto-start in background still appear among active windows after login (this might be a Skype problem though)Besides that everything works super nicely! I'm amazed by Deepin. I'm still waiting on System76 to release their Rust-based Cosmic desktop to decide what will be my new Desktop Environment for a long time.

I had high hopes for deepin but ended up disappointed. Pros:- Beautiful environmentCons:- Longest installation time from all other distributions which include an installer.- If following the default installation, it wants 100+ GB of space available when it only uses 7 GB on a custom installation.- Doesn't allow passwords with a space but it does not indicate that, just ""eats"" the space when setting the password but then complains when entering the password at log in.- Mounts all the partitions in the disk, not just the partitions belonging to the Deepin installation.- Automatically runs the search service scanning ALL partitions without warning.- Does not include tiling shortcuts so to reorganize screens it needs to be done by mouse.In summary, it is a beautifully looking desktop environment with a proprietary mentality thinking that they own the computer and can do whatever they want without the user's input."
3383,2022-01-31, deepin, 20.4,2,6,"First impression was average, like any linux.But then had problems with package installerclosing during downloads.Worst part of my experience, lack of power management; suspend, hibernate, brightness all failed, leading to early battery drain. PowerManagement should always work at install.Tasks like file search needs better filtering andshould show on screen as they are found.

3385,2022-01-25, deepin, 20.4,10,3,"Installed to whole disk on an HP Pavilion x360 laptop. I have to say if other Linux distros want to pick up more Windows users this DE is a major step in that direction. I tried Deepin a couple of years back, it was functional and had potential but I did not stay. Today, I am impressed especially with attention given to the whole package. Interface is elegant, uses little ram, great contrast for dim eyes, tools for major needs and minor needs. settings are intuitive and extensive. If I had a friend using Windows and ask what should I install from Linux to replace it, this is the one I would steer him too. Oh I forgot to say once in a while I get a short delay due to resources in use but not much, then again I have not checked swappiness which I always set to one (1). I suppose it is still on default of 60.This would be a pain to install as a dual boot beside Windows but it can be done. You need to read, don't just jump into doing it. That said install to whole disk is a piece a cake and quick. Also boots quick, shuts down quick, I all the quicks this distro has for a full featured desktop OS. Icons are nice, launch bar is really nice. I have used Windows 11, this is better by far, in my opinion."
3386,2022-01-22, deepin, 20.4,10,2,"Nearly ideal system for normal users.  Have found it to be completely reliable on several computers, very good selection of everyday apps that seem to have better design than most other systems.Highly recommend the default install to the whole disk and use the App Store for installing applications.  This sets up partitions so that the operating system base is backed up before every update and configures the boot menu to allow booting the backup if there is any problem, like the new system fails to support something on your particular computer.  Booting into the backup system you will still have your home folder and installed apps just as they had been.  This is very slick, making the system almost unbreakable.I would rate the default install as 8 or 9 out of 10 for developers and debian pros who want to use the Apt command line because the default root partition is too small (the Deepin Store installs debian packages to appdirs in /opt which is on the ""data"" partition with /home and /var).  Experts will be happier with an expert install to manual partitioning or the default install using two drives by selecting an ssd drive as ""system drive"" and a second drive as ""data drive"".  Overall the best linux system I've ever used.  Deepin use the super reliable Qt and Kwin graphical toolkits in place of Gtk3/Gtk4 to build a desktop that is very much like Gnome with the dashtopanel extension -- and better detailing and usability than either KDE or Gnome have achieved."

I also saw a couple different IP addresses (all from China) in the performance-task manager being sent data and was using up a lot of my ram, making my computer fans continuously run like a jet engine- it seems like spyware.

Its basically Arch with a gui installer and an extra package system with excessive routine updates, you would be better off using Manjaro which unlike Arco has a huge user base comparable to Ubuntu. You can easily find answers for Manjaro, this is its biggest plus and its even easier to install than Arco since its a full os that comes packed with apps. Also Manjaro doesn't suffer from constant updating, their bi-weekly updates are still leagues behind Arch so your always compatible but up to date. This in turn makes Manjaro more watered down to be able to be used as the everyday distro. Unlike Arch Manjaro tests all its packages, so the updates are properly functional and won't break anything."
3393,2023-06-07, ArcoLinux, 23.05.04,10,8,"I am a Linux user with Ubuntu version 12.04. I tried about 20 different distributions and builds, but settled on Arco Linux as the only system for home use. It is the best experience of using Linux, Arco Linux gives an unprecedented level of use of your hardware. The major pluses are the guide and the most detailed documentation possible. I used to love Flatpak and hated Snap but now I don't like Flatpak either because of OSTree. Flatpak applications allow access to user files in $HOME and sandbox escape through X11 is trivial. Anyone who works with and learns linux will move to Arhc anyway, but Arco is a great starting point for learning all the nice things about linux. I suggest for newbies to get the XL build. And DO NOT create lots of hard disk partitions, they make no sense. "

I still believe it's the best ""Arch experience"" for beginners but unfortunately the miriad of updates make the system not very stable and that is a limit. I believe they should create  2 version , 1 stable with essential updates and one ""beta"" with frequent updates. So the PROs are : easy to install , big choice of desktop environments and software , great looks , simple and intutitive. The CONs are : updates are too frequent and they might mess up the system. "
3395,2023-05-25, ArcoLinux, 23.05.04,7,0,"Updates frequently leave your system unusable.  It's happened to me several times now.  This last time I lost video from a w5100 FirePro after an update.  If the update process becomes stable, it's as good or better than EndeavourOS,  I had to flatbox 5 installations from two machines after normal updates this year. I installed the B version with minimal applications on two machines.  One Intel and the other an old AMD, fairly painless.  It's fast and Plasma compliant, my preferred desktop.  No printers, wireless or BT on either machine.  When it works, it's fantastic."

I was afraid of the Arch architecture, but this system is put together in such a way that you don't have to be afraid of it. I chose Deepin desktop, but you can find all window management systems. The system is very stable, the boot is very fast, all software included in the storage. I had a problem, Viber didn't start, but it's not the system's fault, I looked it up and it was solved in seconds. I think this will be my system for everyday use.

3397,2023-05-18, ArcoLinux, 23.05.04,10,4,Arcolinux just works. Easy install recommended for 'beginners'. I recently took the opportunity to install some alternatives on my desktop. Garuda wouldn't load with my Nvidia gpu. Endeavour couldn't load with my Nvidia gpu..did load with open drivers but I didn't enjoy needing terminal for all the music software I need. Fedora had problems with Oad software on the Gnome de.. the XFCE spin is a pared down version that gave a similar experience to Endeavour. DAY 3 of the experiment saw me re-installing Arcolinux 23.05.04... everything worked out of the box. Rebooted perfectly with Nvidia drivers. Erik Dubois does an incredible job with this distro and has provided links to his multitude of assistive videos on Youtube. Fantastic service. I choose xfce de for my purposes. In Arco it's simple to install any and all desktops alongside each other. 
3398,2023-05-03, ArcoLinux, 22.12.02,9,3,"9 and not 10 just because sometimes the installer fails. This simply is the perfect Arch distro; it has EVERYTHING you need for a perfect Arch installation. I was a distro hopper until i installed this; now it is my daily driver.I opted for Cinnamon flavor, but you can install every Linux desktop. Marvelous the ""B"" version that literally makes you build the Arch distro you want. Good the ""Big"" version, too, but with one criticism; if you want to offer a ""complete""  distro ready to be installed and used, you should include Libreoffice in it!"
3399,2023-05-02, ArcoLinux, 23.05.04,10,4,"The most complete ""Arch experience"" for beginners.

Huge choice of Desktop Environments , incredible choice of software and drivers , lets you get in touch with the  Arch  world keeping all the conforts of a Ubuntu distribution. Calamares is probably the best installing companion out there now and the one in ArcoLinux is just awesome and precise at the same time. I give this distro a full 10. "
3400,2023-04-29, ArcoLinux, 23.05.04,10,12,"ArcoLinux, hmm, what to say about it. Well, it's a distro for desktops - users and gamers and developers and ""fiddlers"" and even older folk.Well, it is Arch - Arch that installs and works - better than the many many distros that I have tried and used - on all my AMD and Intel hardware, excluding that Intel AX200-series wireless. Guess what, I replaced that Intel wireless.Arco uses Calamares - one of the best installers for newbies. Some variants can also use ""alis"", an installer for more advanced users, developed by picodotdev, and it's the fastest Arch installer that I have used.Arco stole me from EndeavourOS - another great distro. There's a clue. I'd been using Endeavour since dropping Pop!_OS and after trying and being unimpressed by variants of Debian, Fedora, SUSE and so on. There was always something that just didn't work as expected (or crashed).Pros: Choices (loads of choices). Stable (Arco is very stable). Software (Arch has a massive software repository). Layered - you can apply ""the Arco way"" to more than 15 distinct Arch-based distros and it works! Fast - it's generally slightly faster as well. It's tuned the right way.Videos - over 3000. See Erik Dubios on YT. He has playlists and a local search feature.Cons: Choices (so... many... choices...) My solution is just get ArcoLinuXL, install using the defaults, then choose your preferred desktop using the Arch Linux Tweak Tool. Supports Wayland (if you're brave enough to choose it), but Wayland doesn't support a lot and it breaks many things - so don't try it until you're fully Linux versed). Even then, watch the videos that Erik has created on the subject.Definitely 10/10. ""I use Arch, BTW"" doesn't matter when you install and use Arco. It's so easy."
3401,2023-03-31, ArcoLinux, 23.04.03,9,8,"The easiest to install and most functional Arch distribution I've installed. A much better choice than Manjaro. However, the website is a total mess. Updates are extremely frequent. I installed with Cinnamon and KDE. The installation is extremely easy and allows you to install software according to your needs.

From gobs of education and training tools, super helpful versions with differing levels of apps, and configurability you can bank on, I have not found anything it cannot do! But don't let the sheer volume of helpfulness put you off. Just give it a spin and add to your learning or abilities as you see fit, or stay with the defaults and you will not be disappointed. It's GORGEOUS and just a PLEASURE to USE! I have been hammering it for weeks now and it won't break without doing stupid stuff. It feels both elegant to use, but faster and hotter than a fresh fukt fox in a forest fire. If there is one disappointment: I think my gleeful, drooling distrohopping days may be over!

All the options just feel like being a kid in a candy store.

I am only on day one of using it, but have had no problems making it jump through the typical hoops. I will be back if there is any bad news down the road, but I will have visions of sugar-Linux dancing through my dreams tonight, over any of the other Arch derivatves I have played with. That includes all of the top arch distros that support XFCE on Distrowatch. I do suspect that the sheer avalanche of options with Arco is why it's not higher up the rankings on Distrowatch, and I myself held off because it looked like I would have to do some thinking just to get the proper version to intall.

3405,2022-12-10, ArcoLinux, 22.12.02,8,2,"Have been using this distro for at least 1 1/2 years now, it opens fast, allows to set as encrypted, not recommended for non advanced users as later installs might be problematic, it is a rolling release, so no need to reinstall like other Ubuntu type distros for example, I only installed Kde, Xfce & Cinnamon environments, it is stable, and can play around with the theming and fonts etc with Kde. Wish they would beautify more the main theme in the future. I have done some theming to change that but needs work. installed Paru for easy updates & Yay I think is also very nice along with pacman software installers. Ubuntu distros seem to be more user friendly than Arch based, recommend better Ubuntu long term distros 5 years for them. I do have Windows installed on a separate partition but find it too slow and painstaking to use, constantly upgrading   gigantic nonsense pain, I have Linuxmint on another partition and do use it now and then for simple tasks or special backup maintenance when do have issues with my tinkering around. so far this is now my main distro. and use Libvirt and Virtual box for testing or learning. a powerful distro once you start running it, have been using Lts Kernel upgrades only to avoide bugs in the future. so far have a basic GPU and 32 gigs of ram which allow fairly fast use, not for video creation or games enthusiasts. the creators of Arcolinux have extensive videos for those interested in learning about linux. Which is probably why I keep it and because I have been experimenting with syncthing and use multiple desktops for learning about Linux wthin arcolinux. so will stick it for a while. for now gave it an 8 because I feel it's not an exciting theme look."

There are too many choices, which i kind of like, but it takes incredible time especially when you need to repeat it over and over due to Calamares crashes. It's not like OpenSuse installer, where items are prechecked. E.g. metapackage is selected, but on the next screens, the related packages are not selected. Some items are there 2-3 times.Anyways, after all this, the installer will crash when selecting swap. Next time it will crash on partitioning. And this is a golden standard in the Linux world as decades go by. Every single distro including BSD can't handle partitions. Years old bugs are still in Calamares, for example when editing an encrypted partition, it will forget the actual filesystem and say ""LUKS"". Still no simple home encryption is possible, encrypted volumes can't be shrinked and so on. It's nowhere near simplicity and realtime operation of Windows. For password typing avoidage, i have to create inintram, put in on fingerprint USB, and for home drives I have to do PAM systemd tweaks to unlock after login. None of this is offered automatically.

3416,2022-07-20, ArcoLinux, 22.07.03,10,7,"Avec cette dernière version très aboutie, Arcolinux sort à mon avis la meilleure distribution Arch.Plus rapide, plus légère et certainement la plus aboutie, cette version est devenue une distribution excellente que ce soit pour les pro comme pour ceux qui veulent aller plus loin que les distributions ou tout est installé par défaut..Contrairement à la majorité d'entre vous j'ai opté pour la suit bureautique FreeOffice qui elle aussi est beaucoup moins lourde que LibreOffice et qui s'avère suffisante pour mon utilisation personnelle.Les améliorations pour virtualbox comme timeshift permettent une stabilité surprenante.."
3417,2022-07-07, ArcoLinux, 22.07.03,10,7,"I have been tinkering thoughts of moving from Mac to linux, over the last few months I had installed a few VM's and were trying them out. I finally settled with ArcoLinux. There were a few concerns on using in on bare metal but Arcolinux provided the steps and works around it. After using Arcolinux for a few months as well as testing a few more other linux Distro I am glad to have settled with ArcoLinux, there were some theeting stuff with my camera, magicmouse all this was provided in clear step by step instruction and videos.Hats of to the Arcolinux team, I installed the ArcolinuxL version and as up and running in about 15mins. It is now my daily driver. i still have the migration issue from MS Office, but slowly getting a hang of LibreOffice. The this about ArcoLinux is that you need to read and read a lot, this bring about the understanding of how this operating system is used. XFCE was great and their Arch Linux Tweak tool provided such immense help. Sellting ArcoLinux was the best choice that I made. Keep up the good work ArcoLinux Team."
3418,2022-06-03, ArcoLinux, 22.05.02,5,0,"A little buggy and a little weird, that's the vibe Arcolinux left me with. Having chosen option B (why so many options?) I was presented with an installer, in essence, doing much the same thing as far as I could see, as the Calamares installer for pure Arch. It follows a similar  trajectory in terms of choices. That's not necessarily a bad thing but when I elected not to install a games directory, for example, it installed one anyway loaded down with games I'll never use and had to uninstall. Other icons for games were present but not installed and there was no obvious option to uninstall them. It did the same thing with Development and Education, which again I don't need. Maybe this is a KDE thing, I don't know but it was annoying, nonetheless.This is more personal comment but the default theming left me cold. The lollipop/M&M style button icons felt cluttered, garish and clunky. Thankfully most but not all of that could be expunged by changing themes. On the subject of which added themes did not always install or took forever to install. In terms of performance similar to most other Arch derivatives I have tried. It did throw KDE wallet at my upon starting Vivaldi which I could have done without. It also installed Firefox which I specifically did not ask for and never use. Falkon had somehow made its way onto the system  too.I took a lot of time very carefully selecting what was and what was not to be installed so I'm not sure what happened here. In short I wont be keeping Arcolinux. It just left me feeling uninspired and a but irritated. I'll go to pure Arch instead and take it from there. In short some good ideas and feels solid but my personal experience, in practise, was less than stellar."
3419,2022-05-22, ArcoLinux, 22.05.02,1,0,"Arco is a strange kind of distro in many ways from my point of view, and this is already noticeable from the moment you enter its website. A lot of distinct information about many different things being rubbed in your face, most of which has nothing to do with the distro itself, which will probably be irrelevant to most users who just want to know what the project is about or simply download the ISO and install it. This, by the way, is another point that is quite annoying to me, why so many different styles of ISO images when the point that differentiates them could be applied in the same one, simply by giving the option to choose through the installer? to me, it's just another way to confuse the user even more. Another peculiar point of the project is to have thousands of tutorials about the most diverse things, this calls some attention to the fact that if there was the need for all this probably the confusion when trying to use the distro is certain for many people, in several aspects. Anyway, I tried Arco for a few days but I couldn't see many differences from the original Arch, just some scripts to automate the use, a visual appeal (like Archcraft) and some project's own repositories, which mostly have that already in the AUR. I did encounter some problems when updating the system, things with the keyring and such every time a new update was needed, which was extremely annoying so I ended my attempts there."
3420,2022-05-14, ArcoLinux, 22.05.02,1,0,"In the last few months I found myself interested in testing some WM, instead of a complete graphical environment, but I wasn't in the mood to do the entire configuration from scratch, so, after some research I discovered that Arco had some already preconfigured, and after a few days, I decided to try them.The problems I've had already start from the distro's website, a bunch of information thrown in your face, which makes everything so confusing that you can't even distinguish where you want to go or what you're looking for. It's nice to have tutorials and the fact that they want to pass on as much information as possible, but as long as everything is well organized and not all shuffled.Finally, after finding the correct download, I downloaded the ISO and went to install it on one of my laptops. It was from last month, so it would probably have to do some updates, since the distro is based on Arch, which frequently updates its packages. The installation went well, through Calamares, not much different from many out there. With everything installed, I restarted the laptop and logged into the new system. At first, I didn't notice anything wrong, I went right behind to update everything. And indeed, there were packages with pending updates, so I updated them and restarted again. After that, the system just wouldn't start anymore and I didn't understand why at all. The screen was completely black, without showing any information. After a few hours trying to find the problem and not finding any solutions, I gave up.The project guys seem pretty committed, and that's nice, but some edges still need some polishing to avoid unnecessary frustration, as was my case."
3421,2022-05-05, ArcoLinux, 22.05.02,1,0,"After some time away from Arch due to trying Gentoo, I decided to install it again on a second hand Acer Aspire laptop I recently got. But I wasn't willing to go through the whole command line installation process, so I went looking for some distro based on it that had the possibility of installation through some graphical application/GUI, then I heard about Arco. After that I downloaded the ISO image from the site, put it on a bootable USB stick and tried to install it using Calamares, but I didn't have much luck. In a certain part of the installation process, the progress bar would simply freeze at some point and not go any further, and showed no error, leaving me completely unaware of what was going on. After a few more attempts, I finally succeeded in installing it (apparently), but my bluetooth headset didn't reproduce any audio and my connection would spike from time to time, using gnome at least. After some complications, I just let it go and went back to the normal Arch, which I didn't have these kinds of problems. Maybe it is a one-off thing, but it made the experience with Arco disastrous."
3422,2022-05-05, ArcoLinux, 22.05.02,10,11,"Now this is an undervalued distribution if ever there is one. I took a look because it is one of the very few with an average rating over 9.That average is justified.Immediately on boot from a pen drive I was presented with various video options. This was a surprise, given that I have Intel HD Graphics 630 that is usually treated as ""just works"", but I educated myself about modesetting and nouveau using the (excellent) tutorials and, now, have accelerated video in all cases. That is a rarity in itself.Thereafter it is a standard Calamares installer with remarkably few choices - most choices are pre-made and are clearly good ones. There is a large choice of filesystems, though, and I chose XFS. Installation took a couple of minutes after that, with no problems.Really, Arco is vanilla Arch in a very cleverly designed environment which adds a lot of tools without interfering with the desktop environment. Crucially - I use the KDE ""B"" version - KDE is vanilla. There is an unfortunate tendency to cut and shut KDE, arbitrarily removing parts or replacing them with the distribution owner's favourites, but not here. Everything is present and, thankfully, Discover is used as the graphical programme manager.Discover has support straight off for the standard Arch repositories and a number of little-known user-maintained repositories, plus flatpak. This gives a massive library of programmes even without the AUR, which is also supported.Over and above KDE there is well-chosen theming, including a proper black theme, and a choice of terminal and system information programmes. Conky is installed but, by default, is switched off. There is an Arco Tweak Tool with a mass of options (16 pages!) and the Arco Desktop Trasher, which I haven't tried but which appears to be unique as it allows the desktop environment to be replaced without rebuilding. As Arco supplies about 20 desktop environments, including many obscure ones, the Trasher is a great option for a secondary machine in order to try things out.The big surprise is speed. Arco is astonishingly fast - faster than EndeavourOS - and leaves Ubuntu, Mint and even Windows 11 looking terribly sluggish. Even boot is quick - a few seconds on my desktop machine. The only issue I found after fixing an old Arch chestnut (failed installations on first run - the fix is to update the key store before trying the first update) is that my machine won't suspend - it suspends for a few seconds then comes back. However, this is not an issue because hibernate and recover from hibernate take about four seconds each.Overall? 10. All this is simply outstanding work by the developer."
3423,2022-05-04, ArcoLinux, 22.05.02,10,6,"I am a linux user since 1998 and I have used several distros. However I consider myself as an enthusiast rather than a linux expert.The ArcolinuxB Openbox edition was installed on a almost 20 years old MSI CR620 (i3 processor) with 4 GB ram. Installation process was straightforward and everything worked out of the box.The distro is Very fast and responsive, using less than 500 MB memory.I am using it as my main computer now for more than a year with no complains at all. This laptop is always running (24x7) and I never shut it down; it is always on.My main usage is Visual Studio Code, OpenOffice, FreeCAD and some web browser (mostly Min, Firefox and Vivaldi). Occasionally it slows down but it is due my limited amount of ram and the old this laptop is. No SSD here. I just have to close some unused windows and everything is back to normality.The software is always the latest version available. The distro is very well documented and you can look for extra information into ARCH forums.The Openbox window manager is very well integrated with the system and it's quite easy to make personal adjustments. I do not recommend it for those migrating from Windows but novice linux users may give it a try.Congratulations to Erik Dubois and all team. Great work."
3424,2022-03-22, ArcoLinux, 22.03.07,10,6,"I don't like Arch much. There is always some niggle or papercut, or some Archoid user bragging about his system. I've had mediocre results using Endeavour. I have had fair results dealing with Manjaro. (Yes, I'm a distrohopper, even do my own podcast on the subject.)  My main squeeze is Bodhi, with Mint Mate on board for when you just have to get things done.I reviewed ArcoLinux Mate for my podcast (Distrohoppers' Digest) a couple months ago. I couldn't find anything actually wrong, no papercuts, just have to get used to the Arch way of doing package management. I have not removed it from my system, as I have most of the distros I review, and in fact have added it to every system I have except my disk-limited desktop.If I had a tad more experience with the package manager and with getting things done, I honestly could replace Mint with this. I did have issues with the Qt-based desktops, seems they conflict with each other in such a way that you can't run updates. But the Mate desktop is nice and solid, and I also gave a look at the UKUI desktop, which was pretty good but seems to still be not quite ready for prime time."
3425,2022-03-17, ArcoLinux, 22.03.07,10,9,"I honestly didn't think I would continue using Arco when I first tried it. Although I am a fan of pacman as a package manager, I have had stability/breakage issues with Arch and all variants. And honestly, the Arco website is a bit of a confusing mess of options.However, after figuring out what I wanted (ArcoLinuxB, KDE Plasma version), I have installed it and been using it for a couple of weeks. So far, VERY good. Stability is good, updates are seamless, and after my own tweaks, Plasma boots and idles at about 435MB. Pretty incredible. Arco aside, I consider KDE Plasma to be the ONLY viable Linux desktop environment. It has reached the level of polish, performance, usability, stability, consistency, configurability, and energy-saving capabilities that leaves everything else in the dust.I was able to add all the software I needed without issues. There are some things I can do without (what's with the endless fascination with conky, and neofetch in every new terminal window?), but that's easy enough to deal with. The ArcoLinux Tweak Tool seems interesting, although I haven't needed it.As a 23 year Linux user who is more accustomed to the likes of Slackware (still the best), I can honestly say that Arco is an excellent distribution. I will continue to use it until I break it. ;-)"
3426,2022-03-11, ArcoLinux, 22.03.07,6,0,"I like ArcoLinux. I want to like it a lot, but every time I do an update, it hangs up running the post-tranaction hooks. Everything grinds to a halt at that point. I wait and wait for the update to finish, and it may take a half hour or more. This never happened with Manjaro. I don't understand what's wrong. In fact, I don't think this has ever happened with any other distro I've used, and I've used a lot. Such a pity, because ArcoLinux looks great, it's very easy to install, and it runs great. But updates are a pain, and there are always a lot of updates to do with Arch. I think I might go back to Zorin, LMDE, or maybe try Ultramarine. I think we need developers to create some more user friendly Slackware friendly derivatives. "

Installed easily on an MSI B450i with a Ryzen 5600G and several rounds of updates later it is still working great. I was able to install the Vivaldi browser and my mods for wake-on-lan and remote operation using X11VNC. All good. Suspend/Resume works well  Viewing shares on my NAS works right too."

And I really thought I was never going to turn away from Manjaro Linux. But when I first tried ArcoLinux in a Virtual box, there was no turning back.

Arc Linux Tweak Tool is a must have.The Plasma desktop environment is fully supported and works as usual: you can change anything.What makes this community so special is the way they attempt to teach you how to build your own ISO.  Imagine that, you can call it whatever you like and build it from GIT.It follows the Arch Linux concepts and will be familiar for users that are curious after Manjaro or other Arch based distributions.  If you come from the apt side of the equation it simply means you need to take time to read and get these skills under your belt.The knowledge gathered from doing it this way and the thousands of videos that Erik made and is making, are a great help.

It's basically all the functionality most people wish was included with Arch (calamares installer, paru installed out of the box for AUR).  I like Arch quite a bit, but I don't always have time to set up the OS with their scripts, nor do I particularly like how much customizing I have to do with the upstream DE settings to make it not look / feel like garbage. Arco takes care of that (thank god).  IMO it's basically perfect.  The only thing I don't like about it is the way they named their ISO options (ArcoL, ArcoD, etc.).  A descriptive word rather than just a letter would be preferable. They have an infographic about what each channel is for that is helpful, but still leaves some questions.  My recommendation, if you're doing a desktop just download whichever ISO is the heaviest, you can always opt not to install a ton of things but they'll be available if you want them.  The amount of software available during the install process is somewhat daunting, but fantastically powerful and decently integrated (phenomenally compared to vanilla Arch). Has been my daily driver for a couple months and no interest in changing.  Really is a great ""distro"".

Anyone weary of bowing to the dictates of MS Windows, finding themselves wishing they had a truly 'user centric' operating system that 'catered to their needs above all else', instead of being part of MS's 'cash cow' herd, strung along for the enrichment of the company with virtually no interest in meeting their real needs in an 'uncluttered, stay out of their way' manner, dreaming instead of an OS that 'worked for them' instead of so often 'working against them' -- look no further! There is an operating system that's easy to use, absolutely secure, amazingly reliable, and fully customizable, designed to work 'with you and for you' instead of seemingly 'against you'. Linux Mint is the OS option you've wished for and secretly dreamed of -- quite literally among 'the best of the best' when it comes to servicing the real needs of everyday users.The sentiment that's been expressed in, ""Linux Mint shows Microsoft how it should be done for the sake of the user,"" is absolutely true. Microsoft has steadily moved further and further away from serving the real needs of users for over a decade and a half, making their Windows operating systems ever more complex, more commercially oriented towards enriching the company, and at the same time increasingly more difficult to use and ever more expensive to deploy. Linux Mint, on the other hand, is purposely built to be as simple and easy to use as possible, while providing everything, and then some, that the vast majority of desktop users want or need. The world wide Linux community has given PC users real choice and true freedom over the years, and over the past decades has produced world class alternatives to Windows and macOS, among which are Ubuntu based Linux Mint, Debian based MX Linux, and Arch based Endeavor and Manjaro Linux -- four of the 'best of the best' in their respective desktop categories. Ubuntu based Linux Mint offers a number of advantages over today's proprietary operating systems. It's free and open source. It's easy to install and will run on virtually every PC that's been produced in the past 15+ years, and users can customize Mint to their suit their own needs without it balking at what they do with it, like Windows infamously does.Mint is more secure, ultimately more reliable than either Windows or macOS. And Mint makes the journey towards understanding and appreciating all that Linux offers, especially for new users, a step by step adventure that's genuinely a lot of fun!Mint is and long has been one of the most popular choices for everyday users looking for a great Ubuntu based operating system, an OS that offers a huge number of advantages over Windows and macOS. So those who've secretly dreamed of replacing their often 'difficult to deal with' and terribly expensive proprietary OS with something they can truly enjoy for a change, dream no more, Mint is here!"

Got a ""kernel modules couldn't be loaded"" error. After boot repair everything was fine but now icons were missing from the panel as if some of the programs weren't installed. Another issue is if you disable compositing on Xfce you will experience screen tearing on most applications like Firefox, also when opening the file manager sometimes you will only see the window frame and that's it. This distro uses an older kernel as well (5.15) so you might encounter some hardware related problems, the only problem I had was wi-fi related.

Have been using Linux prior to that with PCLinuxOS but went back to using Windows 7 and 10. Started with Arch-based distro like Manjaro but there were bad updates and generally just decisions by the Manjaro team that did not sit well with me. So, I switch to Arch. It was fun for a while but later realized that I did not need the most cutting-edge tech that Arch has to offer.Thus I ended with a more stable and compatible Linux Mint. Have been using this for months now and no troubles to far. When i need my machine, it will turn on and do its job. That's what matters to me now. When I update, I do not have the fear that it might break my install.LM also has every app that most people will need in their operating system. And when you need more, just install via flatpak. I would not recommend it for people who have fairly modern machines though. You'll want Arch for those. However, if you're rocking a machine that's more than a couple of years old, Linux Mint is your best bet. I have it running on a decade old Toshiba Satellite, an E595 ThinkPad and my daughter's MSI Modern 14.  If you find Cinnamon a bit sluggish, just install xfce and you'll be good to go."

3450,2023-07-26, Linux Mint, 5-LMDE,9,14,"You don't get much better than Mint, It was the best distro hands down when KDE was the desktop. This is ""the"" distro for linux beginners, or beginners in general. It is intuitive and has that polish that commercial products have. It is not the fastest but it is responsive and is easy to use with little or no training. I do not hesitate to recommend it to anyone, especially users leaving windows, looking for better safety and security without worrying if your antivirus is updated or even working. Linux in general is a breath of fresh air, and Mint makes it very easy to breathe."
3451,2023-07-25, Linux Mint, 21.2,5,0,"When I first switched to Linux over 3.5 years ago, Linux Mint (19.3) was near-perfect. I was raving about it and recommending it to newcomers, and they seemed happy with it too. But honestly, I can no longer recommend it, nor use it myself.With every version since 20.2 they seemed to be fixing like 1-2 minor issues and introducing several major issues. 20.2 and 20.3 both had a software-installation issue that people on the forum could not help me with, so I downgraded to 20.1. Eventually I started having kernel panics with 20.1. At some point I tried HamoniKR which was based on 20.3 and that distro did not have the software problem, but I did experience a couple of kernel panics there too.With 21.1 I found that several of my favorite applets are broken. The mouse cursor was changed to something completely unusable. The whole point of the mouse cursor is to point, and for that it has to have a sharp tip, but this abomination is round and you can never tell which exact pixel you're pointing at. Changing the cursor strangely did not work properly, as it would still default back to the new bubbly one in some applications. The backgrounds in the login screen no longer change with your wallpaper. But the final nail in the coffin was that my icons for musical files (mp3 and m4a) for some reason were replaced with icons for LibreOffice Writer documents. I asked for help on the forums and the person helping me kept insisting that it's a file association problem, which it wasn't. Icons don't change based on the associated app anyway, but my associated app was Audacious, which it has been for every version since I started using Mint. Eventually they said I should just reinstall the system because nobody could help me.By that time 21.2 came out, so I just installed that. Except for the icon issue, nothing else seems to have been fixed, instead some absolutely pointless changes were added, like Styles, which is a solution to the problem they themselves created by flooding their Themes app with unnecessary themes (like why the hell would you include Breeze, Papirus, Numix and other icon packs there by default?). In addition now my Taskbar (Grouped Window List) broke, shoring only 1-2 items in a group, when in reality there are more. This was the final straw for me.I have to specify that I was using their flagship Cinnamon versions, and a lot of these issues had to do with Cinnamon. This is the reason I'm giving it a 5 and not lower, because I might still enjoy the MATE version (I don't particularly care for Xfce). But this means it is no longer a distro I could recommend to beginners. I would not recommend MATE or Xfce to beginners in the first place (unless they're looking for a lightweight and/or retro experience), and the Cinnamon version is just a mess. An experienced user might be able to deal with all the issues on their own, but a beginner surely wouldn't. And the support on the forums can be a hit or miss (not a Mint issue, support is rarely ever reliable unless you're a paying customer for some corporation and they are obligated to help you). But it's not like any user should rely on support. When I used Windows for over 17 years, I rarely ever asked for support with anything. This is what a user-friendly Linux distro should be, and Mint was close to that 3 years ago, but is no longer."
3452,2023-07-24, Linux Mint, 21.2,10,12,"17 years, still the default option when you want polished, convenient & reliable Linux on a machine. I find 21.2 Xfce to be wonderful even on a 2009 iMac (Yes, a 14 year old Mac, Core 2 duo 4Gb RAM). I have it on an olde Hp Pavillion G6 (Core i3 4Gb RAM), its only concession to modernity being an SSD. Ive been a very long time Linux user. I have grown tired of the OCD fixation on package version & endless upheavals. Incremental improvement is my friend and thusly Linux Mint is. Not just for beginners!"
3453,2023-07-21, Linux Mint, 21.2,7,2,I tried out Mint 22.1 and came away thinking this isn't the Mint I once thought was the best distro. The changes just seem to gosideways and not really improving anything. The cursor change looks more like something that was changed just to be different. The graphic acceleration is terrible dragging windows is just awful for performance at least on lower end but modern CPU with Intel UHD graphics. Compared to what I experience with Ubuntu or even Fedora is night and day difference. I once thought Mint was onto something with Cinnamon but I have to say this release just feels like a stale sideways advancement.  
3454,2023-07-20, Linux Mint, 21.2,8,2,"after install various distros ultimately i found Linux Mint. I am using Linux Mint last 5 years and I never look back!!! it is a great distro and i love the added new icon and theme, but one thing is so annoying is can't change layout with  back to the the precede layout just like pure gnome desktop, it's so weird !!!!!!!I also see some problems in managing multi-screen and has few lags when you switching between them.It is easy to update and upgrade, you can select local repos for speed up your update process.by the far other thing is so easy to work."
3455,2023-07-20, Linux Mint, 5-LMDE,9,6,"Mint is awesome one of my favorites for inexperienced users, I don't use it as much lately because I am partial to the KDE plasma desktop because it is so intuitive. I really like XFCE so that is what I use with Mint. Mint is so good because it is well thought out for people who are new to linux, and need a robust yet easy experience. You can count on mint to be reliable and not easy to break. Most people use this distro for a reason, it works without drama, and it looks good doing it. This distro is much more reliable than rolling release distros, and that is why beginners should start with fixed release model distros."
3456,2023-07-19, Linux Mint, 5-LMDE,9,1,"I've been using Mint for many years now. Many commentators say its good for beginners, really its good for anyone. I can easily use the command line but I use Mint because its the most reliable flavours of Linux, I have used. I will say I exclusively use the Debian based edition, LMDE for short. I have found a lot more reliable personally, than the Ubuntu based edition. I have had kernel panic, password loops and graphical issues with the standard Ubuntu based edition. LMDE has given next to no issues, save being temperamental with manual kernel upgrades. That said, when you mess with the kernel, that's always a possibility. I do think Mint needs to make a few improvements. One key issue is aesthetic's. To my mind, Mints look is dated. Why no support for popular themes like Nordic out of the box? Yes you can rice it, importing custom themes like Nordic and I have, in fact, done this. Cinnamon looks great. Why not have it and other themes like Dracula, as standard options, like KDE? On the subject it would be great to see Mint offer a KDE option, as it used to. I know KDE can be a bit buggy at times but its becoming ubiquitous. Not supporting it, as even core Debian does, risks being left behind.It would also be good to see better support, out of the box, for kernel upgrades in LMDE. I know its easier in the Ubuntu based edition. It would be good to see that type of feature integrated into LMDE, in one form or another.It would also be helpful to see the apps store upgraded. Why no support for some popular applications, for example, Vivaldi browser. I know you can easily download and install it but still, it would make things a darn sight easier and offer more seamless integration. Arch's AUR manages it. Lastly, what about moving from X.11 to Wayland? isn't it time?A few suggestions for improvement here but that said, Mint is still a fantastic distribution and one I use extensively. Its a testament to its stability and usability that I have had it on a laptop for over three years, with only one reinstall and that was because I wanted to start fresh with a custom configuration, not because of any issues with the OS.  "

But found out I can't change week to start from Monday, can't test microphone if it's even working despite showing like is there but doesn't work like is there. Found celuloid monstrosity instead of good old mpv. You can't change color for folders and some other basic stuff. Found xed instead of mousepad, xed doesn't even have line number and it's basically a waste of time.The xfce version of mint is simply a disaster. Very bitter taste for me.

Recently, I have only one doubt regarding terrible Ubuntu (as LM base) heading (snap, etc.), so LMDE is very good optional and backup distribution for all future Linux Mint users.LM is robust, stable, reliable and user-friendly! Excellent support of 3rd-party drivers (especially NVIDIA). Moreover, LM is probably the one of best distribution with very reliable updating/upgrading procedure. I just perform update 21.1 -> 21.2. This is and extraordinary simple and smooth procedure!!!"
3459,2023-07-18, Linux Mint, 21.2,10,2,"Just finished upgrading five different Linux Mint 21.1 MATE desktop PCs to 21.2 MATE using Mint's Upgrade Utility. The process was straightforward and easy to follow on each machine.First, I opened the Update Manager and checked for available Mint 21.1 updates. The Upgrade Utility was listed as an available update after completing any Mint 21.1 updates that were available, I clicked on the ""Upgrade to Linux Mint 21.2 Victoria"" button and the upgrade process began.These upgrades took roughly 20 to 25 minutes to complete, depending on the machine. I was prompted to restart each computer once its upgrade was finished. After restarting these PCs were running Linux Mint 21.2 MATE.I've used Linux Mint 21.2 MATE on my own machine for a few days now and I'm very happy with the upgrade. The new version of Linux Mint appears to be more stable and has a number of new features and improvements that make the upgrade more than worthwhile.Linux Mint 21.2 comes with updated versions of the software included in the base system, including the kernel, desktop environment, applications, and utilities.Linux Mint 21.2 brings a number of new user-land features with it, including a new dark theme, a new welcome screen, and a new sound theme. It's also been optimized for performance, meaning it should in most cases run even faster and more smoothly than earlier Mint versions.I'm genuinely impressed with the new features and improvements that Linux Mint 21.2 MATE brings with it. If you're running Linux Mint 21.1 MATE, I highly recommend upgrading to 21.2.If you do upgrade to Mint 21.2 (regardless of the GUI you choose), make sure you have a recent backup of your important files before you start. If you have third-party software installed, make sure it's compatible with Linux Mint 21.2. After the upgrade, you may need to update drivers or reinstall something, depending of course on the machine you're using. For my part, the 5 different PCs that I just finished upgrading, together with my own personal machine, flew through these upgrades without so much as a hiccup, with all the third-party software they had in place working as it should once things were done and the machines were rebooted.Can't say enough about how easy Mint has made it to upgrade from one 21.x version to the next. Literally a 'walk in the park' experience, something anyone should be able to do!.."
3460,2023-07-18, Linux Mint, 21.2,3,0,"The latest, just released version, did not fix secure boot like it was supposed to. You can't boot the live USB without taking the security risk of turning off secure boot.Why are they using such an old kernel, 5.x when 6.3 is now out of support? Debian should have fixed this. Since they didn't, a large user base distro, like Mint, should have.This is the important stuff, not the window dressing of tweaking the look.I was really looking forward to using this release, based on previous productivity with mint. I use live disks, so with a modern PC, I can't just leave secure boot off all the time. I am stuck on Ubuntu."
3461,2023-07-18, Linux Mint, 21.2,10,6,"I love Linux Mint. I started using it with the release of Linux Mint 12 ""Lisa"". I love the Mate desktop environment. I installed many different distributions, but always returned to Linux Mint. I wish the Linux Mint team creative success. I wish that Linux Mint is always in the first place. Linux Mint is the best.The most important thing is that newcomers try Linux for the first time and like it. Linux Mint is beautiful, clear, and has a huge knowledge base. There are communities where you can get help or tips. It's based on Ubuntu and Debian, and if you can't find a solution on their websites, you can find a solution in the Ubuntu and Debian knowledge bases."
3462,2023-07-17, Linux Mint, 21.2,5,0,"I used Mint from 2012 until 2020 at which time Mint 20 would not install correctly. I then switched to MX Linux. Now, as much as I wanted to use Mint 21.2 as my daily driver, printer support killed the deal. I have been using an HP ENVY 4500 printer for years and have been generally satisfied with its quality and because the cartridges are fairly inexpensive. Mint 21.2 installed a generic printer driver for my 4500. However, when I went to print multiple pages on both sides it prints them in reverse order! Something like this has never happened before in using Linux for the past 15+ years. So I will continue using MX Linux 21.3 (MX 23 has bugs from Debian 12) or maybe really get really bold and install Manjaro!  "

Once again I always come back to Mint in its Cinnamon flavour. I can't stress enough, the excellent work of the Clem team, one of the few in the field that observes and considers the user in their updates. And as a user, I appreciate that I can use a linux system, without a lot of extra work to achieve the operation I want. The community is always willing to help in this or that case of unruly hardware or functionality and applications. The main machine in my case runs Linux Mint with no other OS in parallel. I can work efficiently and have fun at the same time. What more could I ask for?"
3464,2023-07-17, Linux Mint, 21.2,8,9,"Mmmm. I always loved Linux Mint, always was fine to me but I cannot get sufficient reasons to go with Mint when Debian 12 offers to you the same or greater stability, pipewire by deffect and more new, wayland and a new kernel. Compatibility with every program running in Mint.The only advantage I can see actually is Timeshift working without hassle in Mint and the difficulty of create subvolumens in Debian. May be Nemo over Nautilus. To me Debian is more efficient in the memory usage too. I hope what Mint 22 or LMDE 6 erradicate pulseaudio and begin the wayland use."
3465,2023-07-14, Linux Mint, 21.2,9,1,"I recently filled my Venton USB-stick with several distros that I wanted to try out and Linux Mint Cinnamon came easily on top of them all. As a Windows user I can honestly say that if it was not for Mint, my interest in using Linux would be zero because it was the only distro that booted up, installed, worked properly on my laptop while ticking all the right boxes for me. Mint looks and feels polished and it cames with a very good set of default programs. It’s also very easy to use requiried no tweaking from my part. Everything about it feels sensible, logical and also very familiar from the moments I first booted it up on my laptop, I was finally at home and all that was left kas for me to start using my computer, which was now actually belonging to me. I didn’t even know that one could be so happy about the OS because I am so used to them being something I have to fight agaist.Coming from W11 it feels weird to be in total control of the OS that I am using on the PC that I have paid for. No more spying on OS-level or having programs and settings being added/changed/removed without my permission. All the annoying popups and notifications that I am unfortunately so used to seeing are gone. My PC belongs to me now and I am the only person who is choosing what software I want to have installed on my computer. This is how it should have been since I ever started using computers. A huge bonus is that on top of having better security than I have ever had, it’s also much easier to maintain,  How nice it is to have everything updated from the same place and also not to have the updates forced on me either on times when I need my PC. Mint is a beautiful OS that is almost perfect for me in every way. I can’t give it 10 stars yet because of the fact that I get way better battery life when I run with Win11 on my laptop. This said I will keep on using windows side by side with Mint because I have a lot of  Win/Mac only software and hardware that I need to use. "
3466,2023-07-14, Linux Mint, 21.2,9,8,"Linux Mint is the benchmark for ""it just works"" and lightweight on resources such as RAM using only about 1.1GB booting to desktop.  Always curious if there's something better so I occasionally distro hop to try to find out.Recently tried Nobara and Debian.  Nobara is prepackaged with gaming focus but boots to desktop with about double the memory utilization at 2.4GB and trying to run a simple game, Stray exited to desktop after a few minutes so not sure if it's related to memory utilization or something else.Debian 12 is rather hyped about but never had so many issues installing the OS along with basic test software suit and not a fan of the default Gnome desktop environment.  Had to revert to Debian 11.7 to get it up and running but only after digging up the hidden ISO with non-free drivers but there's still the double bluetooth icons on task bar.So, if there's a distro that can one up Linux Mint I've yet to find it but keeping hope it's out there.  Overall, Linux Mint gets a 9 rating and might increase it to 9.5 if it ever supports biometric fingerprint authentication out of box."

3469,2023-07-01, Linux Mint, 3.0,9,19,"First discovered Mint back in 2007 while I was trying out various Distros hunting for an alternative to the Windows Vista abomination. I was working Computer Retail/Repair in those days and the reception to Vista was ugly to say the least. XP users who made the mistake of installing Norton AV or McAfee were facing resource dilemmas or what amounted to Corporate Ransomware attacks..... End Users were flooding in for repairs/returns and began requesting overpriced Apple products as a result. We had even considered carrying Apple Products but were prevented from doing so due to the Extremely high cost to BUY IN and some of their ridiculous requirements. One would think Apple.Inc would have been more than glad to put a store in the middle of the Mall where we proposed...evidently Not. Thus began Kicking around the various Distros to find a suitable alternative, one that the masses would accept. I had been running Mandrake, Redhat and Solaris for years at that point but each of them required a certain kind of ""Geek"", not exactly the sort of thing your grandparents were going to be using for email and obtaining pictures from that digital camera you bought them for xmas. It needed programs that were easily obtained and a layout similar to what they were using before. Mint also seemed to have a certain polish that many of the other Distros didnt immediately have (not without taking steps that would confuse new users anyway). So I began suggesting Mint to some of our customers (initially the more tech oriented bunch who were already dual booting some OS or another). The reception was better than expected and so I began suggesting it the less inclined as well....It was much better received than I expected. The mere mention of installing something other than a Microsoft or Apple product still tends to make people skeptical but I have been suggesting people give it a try for years now with very few complaints. Running the OS from a Live CD or Bootable Flash Drive so they could see an example of their  ""old PC"" was actually capable of without the fear of committing the changes made a huge difference in its reception. We handed out hundreds of copies for customers to try and many of them inevitably became Mint users as well. In those days Mint had barely broken the top 30 here on Distrowatch...It was no surprise to see it climb into the top spots. The developers have done a great job initiating users into the Linux community with every release. Including new variants started some of those users on the path to making it their own and trying other Distros. There are alot of great Distros to pick from but Mint is the one I am most likely to recommend. If youre trying Linux for the first time Mint is the one.   "
3470,2023-06-28, Linux Mint, 21.1,10,31,"I'm a grandmother (not the one mentioned here earlier, at least I don't think I am!) who's used Linux Mint for the past few years. I'm certainly no computer expert, but I find Linux Mint to be very user-friendly, unlike today's Windows, and exceptionally easy to use. The interface is similar enough to Windows that I was able to get up and running with it quickly some years ago when my son talked me into letting him install it on my laptop. I use Linux Mint for everyday computing like browsing the web, checking my email, word processing, and games I enjoy. I've also installed programs like VLC and Audacity, even a Windows program I've used for years that I've installed with the help of my son. It's easy to use and I'd recommend it to anyone, especially adults my age who may be looking for a simple and reliable operating system for their home computer.I like that Linux Mint's interface is similar to Windows. I especially like that Mint is stable and secure, seldom if ever causing any sort of problem. Having moved from Windows to Mint years ago, when Windows had become more of a problem for me than it was worth, I like that Mint just works as it should, month after month, year after year, with little if any fiddling with it other than keeping it up to date, something my son still helps me with.Linux Mint is a great operating system for older adults, or for that matter for anyone looking for a simple and reliable operating system to use on their present computer, without having to purchase an expensive new Windows PC with all the crappy issues and aggravating downsides that come with it.So, basically I love that my old laptop runs like new with Linux Mint in it, and that I don't have to buy something new to run today's Windows. There's nothing I need or want to do with my laptop that I can't do with Linux Mint, and that's the truth!This is one grandmother's heart that Linux Mint warms 'almost' as much as her son does!"

Nice little additions like an uninstall selection on a drop down on the software menu entry To file transfer options like Warpinator etc.. These things may sound trivial but what the LM team understands is that in the fast paced corporate IT world these things are time saving polish that aid production efficiencies across corporate IT. There is much of this polish in Mint and it sets them apart."

It never fails, it allows to install flatpak, the Cinnamon desktop is beautiful and configurable, close to what Windows was before, easy to use.Linux Mint is not Ubuntu. It is an improved Ubuntu, which gives more freedom to install what you want from the software manager you want. Ubuntu still hasn't fixed its snap-store bug: on Linux Mint this doesn't happen. It's true that LM doesn't have the newest kernel, but it does well on both new hardware (I'm writing with a new Lenovo ideaflex 5) and old hardware - I've had it for years on a Celeron-potato.Granny, forgive me: I will never leave home in search of news.

Mint so far is my favorite since its user interface closely matches Windows which I have used for decades but find the direction Windows 11 took disturbing. I now only game on a Windows PC and now do everything else on an Apple device either Mac or IOS. But was looking for something for more mundane use and the Mini PC seemed interesting running a much less impactful Linux OS. Mint in the past has always been pretty stable and not quickly jumping into the fray of the latest quest like some of the other distros. I'd rather have stability then become another beta tester like I felt with Windows 11. Incremental improvements is the way to go, but I do have one minor disappointment with Mint. I do not like the default cursor/pointer that has been implemented. I prefer a sharper and not the child like fatter arrow that is the default. It is something easily changed so not a huge deal. "

As a long-time Windows user I was a little hesitant to try Linux, and the idea of switching to it just didn't seem feasible. But I have to say I'm glad I did, and glad that I was encouraged to take the plunge with Linux Mint.Mint has proven to be everything I wanted in a desktop operating system. Easy to use, amazingly stable, and packed with features that give it every capability I want in an OS with none of the cumbersome, aggravating stuff I had to wade through with Windows 10 and 11, Linux Mint 21.1 has truly been a revelation.One of the things I most enjoy with Linux Mint is its Cinnamon desktop environment. It's very user-friendly, and feels entirely familiar to a long-time Windows user like me. The taskbar is at the bottom of the screen, with menus in the same place as they are in Windows. I was up and running with Linux Mint in just minutes after installing it, and I didn't have to learn a bunch of new commands or keyboard shortcuts.Something I really appreciate with Linux Mint is it's stability. In the weeks I've used it I haven't had a single crash or unexpected hang-up of any sort. The operating system is very reliable, and I can always count on it to start up quickly and run smoothly no matter what I'm doing with it.Finally, Linux Mint comes with a wide variety of pre-installed software, including a web browser, an office suite, a media player, and a photo editor. I haven't had to install additional software just yet, and I've been able to do everything I need to do with the software that's already installed. What I'm learning though is that if I do need additional software at some point in time, pretty much anything I might need is instantly available in Mint's software repositories, software that's easily accessed and installed using Linux Mint's Software Manager.I'm really impressed with Linux Mint 21.1. It's a great desktop operating system, and an ideal fit for Windows users looking for a stable, easy-to-use, and feature-rich alternative OS."
3477,2023-05-20, Linux Mint, 21.1,10,12,"Linux Mint 21.1 is an outstanding desktop OS, the latest in a long line of great releases for this amazingly popular Ubuntu based Linux distribution. Offering a number of newly minted features and improvements, including a new desktop theme, a more vibrant default color scheme, and important performance and stability enhancements, this latest edition of Linux Mint is well worth experiencing for yourself. Mint's new theme is called 'Aqua', and features a more vibrantly colorful look than its previous default theme. The Aqua theme uses the new GTK+ 4 tool kit to create a modern, stylish look, something that Mint 21.1 takes full advantage of in its latest release.In addition to Aqua, its new default theme, Linux Mint 21.1 brings with it other visual changes including a new icon set, a new cursor theme, and new wallpapers. These handsome visual changes give Linux Mint 21.1 a more modern and polished look while retaining all the traditional Minty desktop goodness that users have come to so enjoy. Important performance and stability enhancements mean that Linux Mint 21.1 remains the top choice for users looking for the best-of-the-best in Ubuntu LTS based distros.If you're new to Linux and want to start your journey with a legendarily reliable, highly secure, easy-to-use distribution that comes with a massive selection of top-tier software available via its 'Software Manager', then Linux Mint 21.1 is more than simply a great option, it's a choice that millions of users world wide don't go wrong with, a distro I've enjoyed since its first ever release in 2006, one I highly recommend to users of every experience level."

3483,2023-05-10, Linux Mint, 21.1,10,13,"Linux Mint 21.1 Mate is a massively popular open-source operating system that offers a user-friendly desktop environment along with a staggeringly wide range of software options. As a long-term support release, Mint 21.1 Mate' provides users with stability, security, and truly impressive reliability.One of the standout features of Linux Mint 21.1 in my view its Mate' desktop environment. Mate' is a lightweight, intuitive, and highly customizable desktop user interface. It provides a traditional desktop layout with a taskbar, start menu, and system tray, making it easy for users new to Linux, particularly those from a Windows background, to navigate the system.Another great feature of Linux Mint 21.1 Mate' is its software center. With a wide range of applications that are easy to install and use, Mint's software center includes popular open-source applications like Firefox, LibreOffice, and Thunderbird, along with a huge variety of multimedia, graphic design, audio, and software development tools among others.In terms of performance, Linux Mint 21.1 Mate' is fast and responsive, even on older hardware. Anyone new to Linux will find Mint's community highly responsive when it comes to answering questions or helping to solve problems that may arise. Mint 21.1 Mate' uses minimal system resources, making it an ideal choice for users with limited resource PCs or who simply want to run a relatively lightweight operating system.While Linux Mint 21.1 Mate' offers a nice selection of software right out of the box, some users need to install additional applications to meet their needs. This is easily addressed by installing additional software from Mint's all inclusive Software Manager.All things considered Linux Mint 21.1 is a genuinely great operating system, both for users who are new to Linux and want a stable, reliable, easy-to-use system, or experienced users who appreciate Mint's work in their behalf by providing the top ranked Long Term Support Ubuntu based distro available anywhere, and doing so faithfully for the better part of these past two decades.Linux Mint's highly customizable desktop environments, including Cinnamon, Mate', and Xfce, together with the huge range of software options it provides and its exceptional level of security and performance, make it a top choice for anyone in search of a great desktop Linux experience - something that I've come to appreciate about Mint over the years I've used it."
3484,2023-05-08, Linux Mint, 21.1,1,0,"As a previous user of Mint, I had been using POP OS and MX Linux and wanted to go back to MINT to see if there was anything new.  I tried to burn ISO image to a DVD then do the install but it wouldn't work.  I knew there was some sort of problem, because the DVD would take an unusual amount of time to load and start up.  After the install, the reboot the bios would tell me to install a bootable image to the Hard Disk, that nothing was installed.  I tried to install to a USB and that worked but installing from the USB would give the same results.I went back to MX Linux, which has its own unique problems but most of which I can deal with.  I've also tried Magia (excuse the spelling), Fedora, Pop OS, and Ubuntu.  I don't know what you all did here but somethings not right and I'm sure that there are many others with the same problems.  When I go to Discord or any other forums and tell them about this, they act as if they've never heard of this before and no one can give me an answer to why this is happening.  The one good thing is that I got it for free.  So I'm not out any money and can go try another distribution.  I'd be really ticked off if I had paid for a product like Windows OS and this happened.For now, I'll just use another distribution."
3485,2023-05-05, Linux Mint, 21.1,10,12,"A number of months ago I switched from Windows to Linux Mint 21.1 as my primary operating system. This change over has been a remarkable experience with many surprising discoveries made along the way. From its three user-friendly interfaces to its stability and reliability, Linux Mint has shown itself to be a top-notch Linux distribution. Some of what I found particularly impressive in Mint are:Ease of Use: Each of Linux Mint's three interface choices are intuitive and user-friendly, making it a perfect choice for both newcomers to Linux and experienced users. The Cinnamon desktop environment which I use provides a clean and organized layout, similar in a great many ways to the traditional Windows desktop. Cinnamon goes a long way towards easing the transition to desktop Linux for Windows users. Navigating through system settings and applications in Mint is a breeze, making for a smooth and enjoyable experience.Software Manager: Mint's Software Manager simplifies the installation and management of applications. Offering a vast library of software, categorized and rated by the community, it makes discovering and install new applications a breeze. Mint's Update Manager ensures that the system and its installed software are always up to date, enhancing security and stability.Stability and Reliability: Linux Mint has been rock-solid in terms of stability and reliability. Built on Ubuntu's LTS (Long Term Support) releases, it provides the exceptionally benefits of that well-tested base system and receives all of its security updates. I've used Linux Mint for several months now without any crashes or major issues at all, providing me with an amazingly stable platform for my computing tasks.Customizability: Linux Mint offers users a high degree of customization. We can personalize our desktop environment according to our own preferences. Changing the theme, tweaking panel settings, selecting different applets, or anything else we want to do with our desktops, we can do to our hearts content. The unobstructed flexibility Mint provides users allows each of us to create a unique and highly personal desktop experience, something I truly enjoy.Vast Community Support: Linux Mint users enjoy a thriving community that is always ready to help. Official forums, community-driven documentation, and an incredibly active user base contribute to a vast storehouse of knowledge where users can find solutions to their queries or troubleshoot problems they may encounter. The community's friendliness and willingness to assist make it easy for newcomers to seek guidance and feel included as part of the Linux Mint family.I confess that Linux Mint 21.1 has exceeded my expectations in terms of usability, stability, and community support. It provides a polished, user-friendly desktop environment that caters to both newcomers like me and experienced Linux users alike. Whether you are looking for a reliable daily driver like I was, or simply seeking to check out a popular Linux alternative to bloated and rigidly constrained closed-source operating systems, from my point of view Linux Mint is an excellent choice, one the overwhelming majority never regret making!"
3486,2023-05-05, Linux Mint, 21.1,9,8,"I am very satisfied with the Cinnamon version. It encountered the hardware without any problems. AMD FX 8100 RT5500XT. The installation of AMD proprietary files are in the Mint archives, all you have to do is type AMDGPU-PRO install. Same for Lutris. Everything works excellently except Stable Diffusion (InvokeAI a little better) these software installs but does not do the job. (p.s. this is a problem I have encountered in many distros except Kubuntu 20.04). Mint is super light and saves significantly on memory consumption."
3487,2023-05-01, Linux Mint, 21.1,1,2,"My Journey Started with Linux Mint 19 Cinnamon. It was working great. The Updates to 19.1 and 19.2 didn't broke anything.After the Release of 19.3 the Bug Festival was starting out of the Box.With 19.3 the Audio and Video Stuttering (Local Videos Included) began there was no Solution to fix it.Forums all full of these Bugs yes its Included also the new Version 21.1. Was trying to use XFCE and Mate but these bugs didn't gone away. Using a newer Kernel, Graphic's Driver, other Media Player didn't work. The same goe's also for LMDE 5. My Personal Ressonance...In every newer Version of Linux Mint it's getting more Bloat and more and more Unstable. "
3488,2023-04-25, Linux Mint, 20.3,10,6,"With this distro I started using Linux as main system.I tried many distros, but none of them didn't run as good as Linux Mint.Everything here is running out of the box, only thing I changed was video player (VLC instead of Celluloid). No snap packages is very good point in my opinion.Cinnamon is my favorite DE since I've seen it first time. By appearance it's looking like something between Windows 7 and XP. The version 5.2 is the best version, because has window animations, very cool calendar and is very stable and it's the last Cinnamon version, which is using Metacity (5.4 and 5.6 don't and that's why user can't configure theme for window borders). The other two DEs are great too, because just like Cinnamon they have conservative look and I love it.Mint applications are great too, starting with Mintupdate, which is the best update manager I've ever seen. Text editor named ""Xed"" is amazing and looking nice and the file manager Nemo, which is the part of Cinnamon DE, has so many useful functions and user-friendly interface. Photoviewer ""Xviewer"" is great alternative to Windows Image Viewer for Windows user. Mintdrivers is great program for installing proprietary drivers (it's much easier comparing with Windows).Comparing with Ubuntu, thanks to ""no snap"" and having less bloatware the Linux Mint is using less RAM, CPU and disk. It's running well on tablet-PC devices.Unfortunately, in Linux Mint 21.x are new changes, which are making using the OS worse, for example issues with mouse, DE issues (very often in Cinnamon 5.4. which has new version of Window Manager), some missing settings (fortunately some of them've returned in Cinnamon 5.6), PPA issues (Ubuntu 22.04 issue) and other issues, so the best way having stable system is to install version 20.3, which has support until May 2025.Pros:StableWorking out of the boxConservative lookSimilar look to Windows XP/7 (good for Windows users)Mint-X iconsMint & Xapps - MintUpdate, Nemo, Xed, Xviewer, Mintdrivers,..."
3489,2023-04-19, Linux Mint, 21.1,1,2,"Not a fan... just too far behind for me. Additionally, they don't have any desktop environment I like.Linux Mint bundles too much out of the box. And with Flatpak ingrained in the operating system itself, there's just no way I'm interested in using this. Try to remove it and you're going to have troubles. Reminds me of how elementaryOS and ZorinOS are configured. I won't use those either.Kubuntu is what I recommend for beginners. It's simple, looks and feels great! Drivers also have not been an issue as is yet.Linux Mint looks and feels like I'm stepping back in time. And that's not something I'm looking for."
3490,2023-04-15, Linux Mint, 21.1,10,2,"Linux Mint 21.1Personally I tried many other distributions and when I found Mint I undertood it was THE one to use.And this, since version 12.As it is based on Ubuntu, not only you have a large community of Mint users able to help, you also have the larger user base of Ubuntu willing to help too.Mint people are reactive to issues. The MATE version is very polished and easy to navigate into.The addition of APP images (not specific to Mint) adds a big plus to the use of Linux now.A big plus to Mint, and again may be to other Linux, are the updates. It takes seconds when an update is available to install it without a need to restart, contrary to a well known operating system."

A very low powered laptop, that should have been recycled long ago. I just hated to do that. I tried several other distros before settling on this. This distro worked well on first install. All drivers were installed, even Bluetooth. It is very light on resources. It has allowed this old tired PC, with some older parts to be useful again. Like the tiny 32GB SSD.    Typically too small for PC use. Total install with the software I wanted and I still have almost 20GB to spare. I know it is not much, but it does emails, casual browsing, youtube videos, and movies really well. I have a CD burner and I make music CD's with it. This is not of course my daily, but if I had to, it could be used in a tight. It just works. This could be put on any old PC, and given to children to learn on, and play with. If they break the OS, just reinstall and go again. Its easy to install, no special knowledge needed. Easy to set up, and get the software you want installed. I guess this would run really fast on a not so old or new PC, and could replace any other OS as a general daily driver. It has a pleasing looking desktop, easy to navigate to files  I can not really think of many cons that really amount to much. Depends on what you do with a PC I guess. There will be certain things this will not do well. I do hope for a 64 bit PC version to be able to make use of more ram. But so far I have not needed more then the 4GB's installed. I will say Linux has come such a long ways.

Basic tools for everyday work, like LibreOffice, take forever to load. Many of the pre-installed packages, including the pre-shipped Sonic Pi, do not work at all. Included non-CLI tools for package management and installation work extremely slowly, make it problematic to access basic software utilities that should work perfectly fine on my hardware, and installing Synaptic (not-included) does not really solve the problem. Given that the system doesn't include even a utility for flashing .iso images to USB, and is the only Linux distro I've yet encountered that does not include Vim and makes installing Emacs a pain, the system is simply unusable — and my needs are really pretty basic, revolving against text editing and processing plus a little bit of a very, very unsophisticated sound recording.

This is my daily driver on my main laptop. What I find most impressive about the budgie desktop is that this is what gnome should have been. I'm not a fan of Ubuntu's gnome desktop so Ubuntu Budgie with really nice theming is exactly what I needed. This distro comes with all the usual Ubuntu goodies and I find it snappier than main line Ubuntu. I'm running this on a MacBook and have gone as far as setting up a theme to give it that Mac OS look and feel. I've integrated all my online cloud drives from Dropbox to Google and Microsoft OneDrive. I have Libre Office but also Microsoft office 365 as a native app that runs via the edge browser. I use only edge browser and Google Chrome browsers depending on what I'm doing etc.I have set timeshift up and make snapshots every week and save them to a second SSD I have installed inside my MacBook having removed the dvd drive to make space for.In my opinion its the best Ubuntu flavour out there with support into 2025."

Being an ex Gnome fanboy, I off'ed Plank for a more spartan desktop.  The Budgie menu is so fast and logical I just use it, keystroking to whatever I want in less than 2 seconds.  I switched to an Ubuntu based distro since Ubuntu seems to be Microsoft's favorite distro.  I love and hate Microsoft at the same time so what better way to live.  Goodbye Xfce old friend.

3507,2022-08-07, Ubuntu Budgie, 22.04,10,9,"I haven't used any Ubuntu as my daily driver until now.  Just on a whim, I decided to give Ubuntu Budgie a shot, mainly because I knew Ubuntu has a reputation for stability, where most, if not everything, just workis out of the box.  I've been a Linux user for going on 18 years, and a Manjaro user for the past two years.  Before Manjaro, most of my experience with Linux has been centered around Debian based distros, and only recently have I began using something Arch based.After a live session, I committed Ubuntu Budgie 22.04 to my laptop, wiping out Manjaro Gnome. I've found Ubuntu Budgie to be quite remarkable.  Installation is typical of the 'buntu family - It's honestly the first distro which looked nice enough, and functional enough, to make me seriously think about switching to it permanently.  It's very easy on the eyes, even the light themes.  It detected my Samsung printer, and my additional monitor with no action on my part at all. I was also happy to be able to remove the Snap Firefox with a single click and install Brave browser with another.  Installing or removing software is easy.  Boot time is okay, not particularly snappy, but encryption likely adds some seconds to boot time.Once booted, though, just about everything opens quickly, if not immediately.  It's a smooth and clean desktop which stays out of your way, but looks awesome just sitting there at idle.  I installed the weather-show applet, along with a global menu, and I am MORE than pleased with the results.Not everyone is going to have the experience I've had the past twenty-four-plus hours with Ubuntu Budgie, or any Linux distribution.  I've had my share of installations which were mostly a waste of time, and/or distributions which show up half baked and not ready for prime time.  There's just too much variation in hardware for a one-size-fits-all, and everyone's needs are different.  However, in my experience, Ubuntu Budgie is one of the most elegant, polished versions of Ubuntu I've ever come across.  Based on my experience so  far, this one is definitely a 10.   "

Start Menu or a right click on the Desktop window will get you access to your settings.  Good organization, clean and easy to navigate.Applications: 10 - Ubuntu Budgie gets you off to a nice start with standard applications but the Ubuntu store is setup nicely and the performance is excellent while search and download applications in the store.  Applications install and menu population are quick and smooth.  So far, I haven't experienced any glitches or performance issues with application usage and resource utilization is low and that's without manipulating the SWAP or running a maintenance program such as Stacer.Eye candy: 10 - Very nice.  This OS provides a beautiful selection of wallpapers (right-click the desktop for access), and the Budgie Themes & Layouts option found in the Start Menu gives the user Appearance and Desktop Layout options for flexibility that supports optimal production environments.Performance: 10 - So far, the Performance overall is lovely.  I heavily use GNS3 running many virtual devices while watching YouTube videos, running LibreOffice apps, MS OneNote via CrossOver, etc and nothing lags or breaks.  Although I'm running a unit with good specs still didn't do the best with Zorin OS 16 Pro, Linux Mint 20 Uma, LinuxFX 10.8.4.  Network Connectivity: 10 - Ethernet, Wireless, Bluetooth, printer setup - no issues.I can't speak to gaming performance on this OS.  I'm very interested in how gaming would work on this distro.  Keeping an eye out for additional reviews :-).Overall: 10 - Ubuntu Budgie 20.04.3 is sorely underrated.

While still somewhat a newcomer to Linux, I believe that users with any type of experiences would conclude that visuals and ease of use are key to a successful distro.  I've tried a few along the way (Ubuntu standard, Ubuntu Mate, Fedora, and Elementary OS).  My main choice over the past several months (especially with the recent upgrade) has been Elementary OS due to the similar overall feel & style to MacOS.  However, along with it came some disappointments.  Since I've had generally good experiences with previous Ubuntu flavors, I figured I would try the Budgie version.  I've been using it the past month now and based on the overall experience thus far, I favor this version over all of the previous Linux distros.  It's customized to have an overall MacOS feel to it, while being easier to use than Elementary OS.  At the time of this review, this version sadly appears on the low end of the overall score list.  My hope is that eventually the popularity of this version gains steam and moves up!   Definitely a version of Linux I would recommend to newcomers for sure.  "

Other than a few issues converting configuration from PfSense to OPNsense, and re-instating my firewall rules, I've had no issues.  OPNsense scheduler did a better automatic optimization than PfASense's WRT bufferbloat. So I found both PfSense & OPNSense very good, but plan to stay with OPNSense so that I can free-up an SSD for more important play."

in comparation to gentoo it is too bloatedif one choose minimal profile on gentoo to build system, there will be flags available for almost any option in source supported by original maintainer, gentoo devs make little changes to fit source into portage system.While on exherbo, almost half options (use flags) will be hard enabled in source.so, user have more freedom and configuration on gentoo than on exherbo. If somebodie doesnt like exherbo source, for sure he can make his repository and than configure packagesm but its not always easy to compile them later and install with cave.exherbo is for users who doesnt mind to have bloated system for year or two with great learning curve until they really learn how to do it well.Cave is better tha portage, but thats it. distribution is worst, repositories are bloated with hard enabled supports in source... i give it 5/10"
3538,2021-05-17, Exherbo, current,9,10,"All in all: A solid source-based distribution with better infrastructure than (but not as much support or documentation as) Gentoo. Not well-suited to non-technical users, but technical ones will appreciate its configurability and repo federation. It's been my daily driver for five years.I tend to judge a distro on its package management, since that's what all of them try to do. In that sense, Paludis strives to be ""a better Portage""--its conceptual models are cleaner, the vocabulary was chosen more sensibly (""options"" instead of ""USE flags""), likely in retrospect. As a result, I've found its errors to generally be more comprehensible than Portage's at a first glance, even though it's documentation is much poorer (and nonexistent in some cases). There are many tips and tricks to using it capably, but that's beyond the scope of this review, unfortunately.The project is tiny, and it cedes that other users need to help with packaging. To that end, there are numerous ""unofficial"" repositories with packages, and they're a first-class feature (unlike Gentoo's afterthought of ""overlays""). If you're using something esoteric, chances are you might have to package as such yourself--but Paludis can also import ""built"" root images for you, which is especially handy for proprietary software.Aside from that, some LFS knowledge would be handy, as this distro is certainly not turnkey. But it's one of a few that can support my whimsy (like non-systemd) and not _be_ LFS. If you have a fairly-performant computer and a few days to kill, try it."
3539,2021-02-26, Exherbo, current,5,0,"Attempted to install Exherbo, but for some reason, most of the compilations failed because the repository was ""unavailable"", even after syncing and checking all the config files. I can't wrap my head around these errors, and I've installed CRUX Linux (which, btw, is basically Gentoo with a local ports system and a different codebase/package manager). This wasn't originally going to be a problem until I was supposed to rebuild @world to install systemd (the default init system for some reason), something I wasn't able to do because of some errors involving Git. rebooting, systemD appeared to work properly, until it froze at a certain point every time. This is probably just me (a lowly Slackware/Arch user) not knowing what I'm supposed to do, but If I can't wrap my head around the package management (the syntax is friggin terrible, -x is the least obvious install flag in the history of install commands), and be able to install other source distributions like CRUX, then what the heck is this?even disregarding this, I'll continue. When paludis/cave did work, it worked like a dream. that alone earns this distro 5 points. but, if basically two-thirds of all the packages won't install because of incomprehensible errors, and this leads me to be unable to install the distribution, then it's safe to say I can't use this. Probably just me being stupid and not knowing how a ""real distribution"" works, but I couldn't find these errors in any of the documentation (or at least where it was obvious). 5/10 for being unusable. I'll be sticking with CRUX and prt-utils.

It was the newest 23.02.02 version I downloaded for a normal 64 bit Intel/AMD PC.It came as a 2 GB img file which inflated to 9 GB+ on a USB stick using Belena Etcher.It doesn't use persistence, but I did find an option to save the session and it seems to work fine.Bad start as I noticed the spinning dotted circle favoured by Microsoft as it loaded - please drop that unnecessary nod to Windows, you can do better and are risking a possible lawsuit too.Not the quickest loader, but that may be down to the USB2 stick I used and it does run at an acceptable speed once it's eventually loaded.Comes with Google Chrome (and Firefox for all you purists) along with a fairly sensible set of common programs without appearing too bloated.I know it's not really meant for 'normal' PC's but it does a good job as a portable OS and barely uses 1/2 a GB of RAM to boot to the desktop."

This is about as good as OpenSuse gets. I tested Regata in live mode and all went well. I followed that with an install, and it went seamlessly, and could not have gone better. Getting Regata ready for everyday use, I felt very comfortable. Like this was a Linux distro from years gone by, but very up to date and modern. I believe Linux Mint is the standard that all other distros must be judged by, and Regata is very close to that. I had no second thoughts about making Regata one of my main operating systems. "

Very minimal, very clean.  How refreshing!  The stark Openbox menu system is simple and easily customized using the GUI configuration tool. The default apps and tools are fitting and complete for an initial work set-up. Synaptic installs apps easily, Thunar navigates fine, and Catfish seeks! Just enough desktop themes to add a tad of uniqueness to the screen while maintaining simplicity.    Still, that's a personal thing. Also, runs on a i3-3110M CPU @ 2.40GHz, one of the very first 64-bit processors.  Not a speed demon, or game machine.  Rather, a work box that works well.

The Openbox window manager is highly customizable, allowing users to configure the system to their hearts content.

Tested UBP on a FairPhone 4. Installation simple and smooth.The interface is simple and very effective.However, the ecosystem behind is not mature : many apps install successfully but don't work OOB.Worse for me  : the display. No HiDPI management : everything is so tiny it's barely legible (I'm wearing glasses).It's a preview of things to come (and a fantastic one) but still immature.I reverted to Lineage. But be warned!! UBP did something on the /persistent readonly folder and the fingerprint sensor was not working anymore.Needed to boot a root flash and 'restorecon -FR /mnt/vendor/persist"" to get it back.Testers should be forewarned of such incongruities..The 6 is for usability as of today.

For a mobile device operating system that is in effect funded by a charitable foundation and developed by a volunteer community, it has its issues, but these are really outweighed by it's quirky difference to the mainstream and the number of devices it has been ported to. It is a great challenge to port as a lot of device hardware is proprietary, so each device has to be ported to individually. Then couple that with the way some manufacturers put blocks in place for ""security"" reasons and of course the older hardware issues, usually declining battery life. There are now over 70 devices in the port, so if you have an old phone lying around, which I did, there is a good chance you could revive it and make it useful again.Android an iOS are kind of the polished items, but are let down by bloatware (why?) and the constant sneaky use of your data (why?). Ubuntu Touch does not have this and you can essentially make it your own, be as open or private as you wish. There are going to be issues as there is with all software, but persevering and working through, there has generally been a solution.Overall, this is really good to revive older hardware that has been orphaned by the manufacturers and give it an interesting new lease of life."

3572,2023-03-12, helloSystem, 0.8.1,1,2,"At its current stage, helloSystem is close to unusable. There is zero progress towards the declared lofty goals of binary compatibility with macOS and offers little else. It's not in some kind of awkward development state. The project's entire premise is deeply flawed.Something I'm missing from all reviews of helloSystem this far is that the macOS lookalike desktop is a mess. It is an affront to anyone who has spent any time with macOS. It betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of the design goals of the macOS desktop.Design is not what it looks like, it's how it works. As is, there is nothing but a shallow skin on top of X. This skin does not serve any purpose except looking like an absurd bizarro world distortion executed by someone lacking taste and sensibility. There's simply no point to it. One would be better off using Gnome, XFCE or one of the other purpose-built, coherent desktop environments. This is unlikely to ever change, as X is not only officially deprecated, it's fundamentally unsuited for cloning anything even resembling macOS.Combined with the stated goal of eventually being able to run macOS software on this FrankenOS, one has to wonder how realistic even a fraction of those goals are. To ever get any traction, you'd have to start at creating a new window manager, a new desktop environment similar to Aqua, somehow find a way to use launchd and plist files and translate untold numbers of system calls. Ultimately, you'd have to bend FreeBSD into Darwin and then build alternatives to everything else macOS from scratch. Even if you eventually succeeded, decades later, you'd still lack the integration features that make macOS so relatively smooth and valuable to end users.ReactOS is the closest comparison, an attempt to do a clean-room implementation of Windows. The fact that after 25 years of development there's still no stable release should give an indication regarding to what kind of work is involved in reaching binary compatibility with a distinct operating system.In my opinion, helloSystem is the worst of all worlds. It looks bad, works so-so, solves nothing and messes up a lot. The project's goals are overambitious and its execution severely lacking. Not only is it no alternative to macOS, it's not an alternative to anything."

3575,2022-11-19, RISC OS, 5.28,10,8,"
Having used RISC OS for about 34 years, and the Open Source version since 2018, RISC OS seems to be a very good OS.  RISC OS is the very first widely distributed OS for computers using the ARM CPU.RISC OS is mostly written in ARM Assembly Language and runs very fast on any ARM HW that it supports.  It stays out of the way when needed, while providing for very good services and just the correct amount of memory protection (in my view).  The native API/ABI of the OS is very intuitive and easy for a single person to understand completely.  This simplicity makes programming for the OS much more capable  than it could be.  RISC OS truly obeys the rule of KISS to provide more ability.Most of the features of RISC OS are provided by Modules, a method of extending or patching the OS in a logical way.  Modules are the RISC OS native form of OS and User Libraries, having many advantages over other forms from the view of some at least.  Even the kernel shows itself as a module.RISC OS has a unique Windowing System (simply called WIMP) that provides for a very usable environment to produce Applications that are very easy to use once one is accustomed to the UI.  Being different from others there is a bit of a learning curve for those new to the OS.The Desktop Environment built into RISC OS (known as Desktop) consists of a few simple modules working together, and provides for a very complete experience.  The Desktop Environment aids in keeping a simple UI (once one is accustomed to it), that allows for a level of Drag and Drop unheard of on any other OS or OS distro that I am aware of.  Even saving files is done with drag and drop, by dragging to a file window in the desktop to specify where to save (without any standard file dialogs at all).  Dragging data from one application to another makes for easy cross application work, allowing more to be done with simple applications, more easily than for modern systems, even to the point of being more capable than modern mega applications.Do the the long history of RISC OS, there are a huge number of applications of all kinds available for just about any possible need.  It helps that the OS maintains binary compatibility from the first version to the current version, even where the ARM has changed in what would seem to be incompatible ways (though only AARCH32 as it is now known).RISC OS is a good somewhat lite weight OS, with the current version taking as little as 8MB of RAM at startup (assuming a softload ROM image, less if using an actual in ROM version).  This may seem a little bit heavy, though there are versions that take even less and it is possible to build a custom ROM that can take a good amount less.From a programmers point of view RISC OS is great.  With ARM Assembly being among the nicest Assembly Languages of any CPU, and the API / ABI being very much ARM native, this is a greatly eloquent OS to program for.  Though ti should be noted that C is not an ideal language for the structure of RISC OS (assembly language being Ideal, with some good options for HLL's)."
3576,2022-09-13, RISC OS, 5.28,9,4,"This OS has seen its hey day, but, if it was bought back to life I would be using it! I used RISC OS since version 3.1 4.x and now 5.28 on RPi and RiscOs Select  6.20 on RPCEmu. I still own a RiscStation R7500. It takes a bit of getting used to for the uninitiated, this operating system was doing things in the 80s and 90s that other systems implemented decades later. I have installed a complete suite of apps from word processors, graphics, desktop publishing, databases, networking etc. The best part is that I can just drag and drop anything into anything else and it just works. So, I can create something in Vecotor graphics and drag it into Writer+ and there it is. Techwriter Pro, which is still being sold, allows files to be saved in word, RTF and Tex formats, otherwise you're stuck with proprietary formats . However, files can be exported to PDF.

I started from Trisquel-mini 8.0 and Trisquel classic 8.0, but I had some problems with screen tearing and Orca (I failed to disable it). I was a bit sceptic to try Triskel, bacause I thought I would be too heavy for my old laptop, but I was wrong. Finally, I installed Triskel 8.0 and everything worked perfect! Since then I used Triskel on both of my laptops and every version from 8.0 to 11.0 works perfect. They works much faster and smoother than my more modern and powerful PC with Windows 10 (unfortunately, I need it for work).If you tried Trisquel or Trisquel-mini, and had some issues, try Triskel. It might help you.The distro itself is very user-friendly (especially Triskel) and may be the best choice to switch from Windows to Linux. Somehow, Triskel works better than Linux Mint and Uduntu, thougth it has no proprietary blobs. Also, I tried Fedora and Debian, but Debian was not really stable (suprisingly) and not so user-friendly, and Fedora uses Gnome and I really didn't like it.Every user is different and every computer is different, but Triskel is worth a try at least."
3582,2023-04-17, Trisquel GNU/Linux, 7.0,5,3,"My very first try of Linux was Ubuntu... that I dropped within a week for Trisquel.I was immediately charmed... until I had to get in touch with the community requesting help because the wifi didn't work...And the joy was gone for 2 reasons:1) ""Community doesn't provide help to support non-free driver""> This attitude let the newbie circumspect & helpless2) The tone was way too much categorical!> which is confusing for someone coming to Linux especially for the ""freedom aspect""No other choice left than buying a new component... or drop their distro!Choice has been quickly made... So I fully agree with Jesse's review (April'23) on his second tought that: ""it's a shame I'll probably never be able to use Trisquel as my daily operating system. It's unfortunate, but most devices these days need non-free firmware to access the Internet and are not much use without this key feature.""Even almost 10 years after, I still have the feeling that their diktat ends in a ""lose-lose"" situation."
3583,2023-03-28, Trisquel GNU/Linux, 11.0,10,4,"Trisquel is great !I tried this version today, that is 28th March 2023. The size of the iso I choosen is 3.1GB.I use a USB stick, with ventoy.My computer is quite old, using DDR ram version 3.This Operating System is super fast!The version of Browser is 110, almost the most updated browser.The welcome screen will pop up in seconds, it looks good, it works fine.The system comes with Libreoffice.  It is a lovely Operating System to me.  Thanks a lot !One of my favorite distros so far. It's a fully free and open source distro. If the default font size is a little bigger, that will be great!"
3584,2022-11-20, Trisquel GNU/Linux, 10.0.1,9,6,"This completely free (as in freedom) and open source OS is the best alternative if you're looking for a system without blobs and with Linux-libre kernel. It has a very nice interface, it's easy to easy, and works seemlessly. I didn't give a 10 because what is missing in my opinion is a better Software Manager; it has one but the UI is not very cool. One more reason for my 9 is that I'd like the possibility of having an update icon, signalling you that updates are available, such as the icon in Linux Mint. I really like it and it would help to keep track of updates, you can choose which one to install etc..."
3585,2022-11-08, Trisquel GNU/Linux, 10.0.1,9,3,"Trisquel offers a very good user experience, while being totally free. Having only free software by default tranquilizes me as I'm sure there will be no spying software and I'm always using safe firmwares. Some people may prefer making configuration changes to the default behavior and this is generally very easy to do. The community is active, support is good and the forum offers a good playground to learn how to secure one's privacy and take good control over the hardware.It is also well adapted to newcomers."
3586,2022-10-25, Trisquel GNU/Linux, 10.0.1,10,12,"One of my favorite distros so far. It's a fully free and open source distro. I and runs very well on older hardware. It's super simple to use and comes with all the basic stuff you need. I tired the LXDE and MATE, which both run great. It comes with it's own fork of Firefox called Abrowser. Tresquel also has a awesome and dedicated community. Just be aware , you may need to do some research if your PC/Laptop is compatible with Tresquel . Also you may need to see if your WIFI card is complatible . A good place to start is H-Node to see what works with Tresquel. "
3587,2022-07-09, Trisquel GNU/Linux, 10.0.1,1,0,"I had a similar experience with Trisquel as a previous reviewer.  I had worked with 8 and 9 also with little problems.  I did a clean install of 10 and my resolution was terrible.  800 x 600 was where I was stuck too.  I had a similar problem getting help.  None of the Trisquel community seemed interested in helping and told me to switch to Ubuntu also.  However, I went to the Ubunutu community and had someone walk me through adding an Ubuntu repository and getting a proprietary driver installed that fixed my issue for a while until the next upgrade.  For me, free software is not a religious sort of devotion thing, so unless you are one of those that just can't stand the idea of proprietary software (which you aren't paying for, by the way......this is Linux......proprietary is still free, just not open source) I would stick to another distro.  Ubuntu is a good alternative, but I went with MX."
3588,2022-07-05, Trisquel GNU/Linux, 10.0.1,1,1,"I worked with 8 and had really no problems.  9 had a few quirks that needed ironing out.  10 is just frustrating and was too annoying to deal with.  The first thing that went wrong on 10 after installation (upgrade and then a clean install) was the resolution on my HD monitor was stuck on 800x600.  Flashbacks to Windows 95....  Nothing I would do would fix the issue.  I went to the community and was told that the problem was in the free drivers and that if I wanted to fix the issue I needed to switch to Ubuntu.  Why was the resolution fine in 8 but not in 10?  It is more that just the free drivers, because 8 had free drivers too, right?  Well, that's what I was thinking.  I was wrong.I worked on this and even went to the Ubuntu community (who were very helpful, but unable to really find a solution unless I installed drivers from Ubuntu, which meant adding Ubuntu repositories and converting the distro to Ubuntu).  Other problems crept in too, but the screen resolution was the most annoying.  I had wifi problems, but managed to work that out with help from the Ubunutu community, oddly enough.Yep, when I went to the Trisquel community, I was told to switch to Ubuntu...again.The monitor issue would not go away.  HD monitor and Low Def OS were just incompatible.  I changed monitors, that was not the problem.  The problem is that Trisquel chokes with older graphics cards and certain models of graphics cards, even newer ones, because the open source drivers aren't real good with certain equipment.What I learned from the community is that hardware support is fading out for some hardware and the free stuff is not doing like the proprietary drivers and maintaining that support for older hardware in the new drivers.  The bottom line?  Programmed obsolescence is worse in the free drivers than in the proprietary ones, apparently.  What is the point of having a distro based on all free and open source material if it doesn't work?  I ultimately took the Trisquel community's advice and switched to Ubuntu."

3590,2022-06-02, Trisquel GNU/Linux, 10.0.1,10,1,"Must be the best independent Linux distro at the moment. It's follows Free Software Foundation Guidelines.Mate desktop is so easy and logical to use, based on ubuntu but without all of this for what ubuntu is hated.With apt package manager you will feel right at home installing your applications.It's used as a server too, being based on ubuntu it's a future of GNU Linux distributions.The only downside for the beginner it might be that wifi does not work out of the box on most cards.But you should be connecting with Ethernet anyway."
3591,2022-05-05, Trisquel GNU/Linux, 10.0,9,4,"A good replacement to ubuntu mate.It's snaps free.There's need some work to improve apps launching because it's too long.It's base on u.buntu mate with modifications.Now, ubuntu impose the use of firefox with snap this is contrary to philosophy of linux spirit which is freedom.Trisquel complies with the free software foundation philosophy.You should give it a try.The installation is the same as unbuntu mate.I use it with 9 other linux distros on my laptop.I like it.I'm in the linux world since december 2020.I love to learn how things work."
3592,2022-03-21, Trisquel GNU/Linux, 10.0,9,3,"As I've tried a fair few distro's lately (antix, MX-21, ubuntu, tails, peppermint, bodhi, kodachi and in the past, suse, manjaro, arch, debian) but have found Trisquel really nice and productive to use. Installing was straightforward (some other distros would not, or fail to restart) and relatively fast. Ok, your laptop Intel wifi might not work, but a usb wifi or power-line connection would be the solution. On desktops, it is worth changing to a different card.Hint: you would like to try many distros easily, Ventoy is your friend. "
3593,2022-02-11, Trisquel GNU/Linux, 10.0,10,258,"I'm very impressed with Trisquel 10. Glad they decided to release a KDE Plasma (with 5.18.8) version; it has been rock-solid stable and fast on the desktop, boots quickly and idles at about 460MB! If you don't need proprietary wifi drivers or other non-free software such as multimedia codecs and such, it makes for a great system. The browser and email client, Abrowser and Icedove, are basically Firefox and Thunderbird, so that's covered. I installed my favorite music player (Strawberry), and everything works great. I'm able to focus on my writing and getting stuff done, the OS just stays out of my way. As I said: stable, solid, and fast. I have found no ""cons"" so far."
3594,2021-11-08, Trisquel GNU/Linux, 9.0.1,8,4,"Wow, what a nice distro! I had no idea what I was getting into with this distro but in the end, everything worked from out of the box. The Abrowser was a big setback, but luckily Firefox 93 installed effortlessly. From then on everything was peachy!There is a limited software choice, but there are plenty possibilities to add your favorite applications. The only glitch I could discover was that when the system goes into sleep modes, some modules, like the internet connection, disappear. A quick reboot settles that problem.The system, despite its 600 mb footprint, feels very light and nimble. I had no trouble going through my daily business with text editing, posting on the net and getting word processing done.So big score for this relatively unknown Bask distro. Cudo's!!!"
3595,2021-10-28, Trisquel GNU/Linux, 9.0.1,9,1,"Seems to work alright apart from a few minor bugs and beetles. One wonderful feature that has to be mentioned is the continued presence of ""gnome-commander"" in ""synaptic"". I am delighted !"
3596,2021-10-28, Trisquel GNU/Linux, 9.0.1,6,7,First install attempt booted to a desktop with wallpaper but no panel or anything else. After wiping the drive with a third party tool instead of using the installer and setting the partitions manually the new system booked OK but the monitor resolution arrived in HD instead of FHD although this did correct itself after another reboot. Trying to do any sort of multitasking (system settings at the same time as copying files from a secondary internal drive or right-clicking on a folder) on a Dell OptiPlex with an NVMe drive and the KDE desktop just freezes. No ability to control or disable the screensaver unless you install the necessary tool. No Wi-Fi possible except for a handful of obscure dongles and even then their forum is full of issues so you either need a cable connection of a spare router to use as an extender. This system is just not robust enough to warrant all the added pain of being able to use designated free software.
3597,2021-07-05, Trisquel GNU/Linux, 9.0,9,9,"Very flexible. Allows and properly uses a particular ppa (non-Ubuntu, non-Debian) for sane (my Canon scanner is not ACTUALLY supported in mainstream sane, although claimed to be supported). I have had no major issues with Trisquel, all updates since installing 8.0 have never broken my system, boots nicely on my i7 based Dell Optiplex. When I tried the live boot method (dd the iso to a spare flash drive), the live session saw all my hardware and used all my hardware, and then, most importantly, the installed distribution ALSO used all my hardware (can't say that for Debian - live works. installed has no wifi - wth?). Not being Ubuntu based means Trisquel has no statically compiled binaries (aka Snaps). I've used Trisquel since 8.0, but am reviewing only 9.0, updated as of today, 2021 07 05"

That started me on this track.I'm getting rid off all the goofles, facepoops and other tracking-evils little by little. I've tried about 10 distros, including Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Lubuntu, Debian (most have been Debian derivatives), including Parrot, Kali, Tails, and for fun I tried Puppy Linux flavors among many others.These are all fine distros, each with its pros and cons--it all depends what the user wants to use them for.So far I feel very comfortable with Trisquel 9 and I like its ""free"" and Linux-libre philosophy. This distro is going in the right direction and I will be supporting it for a long time. I want to encourage users to get involved and/or support Trisquel.I liked the live version so much I decided to install it in one of my old 32 bit computers, replacing Winblows XP.So far I have installed a firewall, macchanger, Abrowser (Firefox) and customize it, and VLC.

I just installed Manjaro to replace Ubuntu 22. After half year I have sound again, though it was a kernel v5 related problem. The booting time is 5 secs again instead of 2 mins. On Ubuntu zsys ate up all the space on /boot, so I was not able to update. With Manjaro the experience is totally different. As of applications, I think Manjaro offers at least three times as many applications in the software manager as Ubuntu. By choosing a new distro another aspect was that I wanted KDE instead of Gnome, because it looks better and I don't have a touch screen. So far Manjaro is a very good experience I think I'll keep it for years. The only thing I am worried about is rolling release, but it appears to be very stable atm."

So, I gave Manjaro a chance after hearing about it on a Linus Tech Tips YouTube video.It’s working fine for me. The good wikis of Arch and Manjaro are really helpful for a noob like me to get things straight. And if you fail to set something up properly, just go on Manjaro’s forum - the guys there are really helpful. I also love the AUR; it has most of the software that anyone would need, and if it doesn’t, you can still use Snap and Flatpak.Of course, there can be little annoying things and sometimes something doesn’t work as intended, but which of the distros I mentioned above don’t have these kinds of problems? I find Manjaro to be straightforward, noob-friendly, and still flexible.I like it very much and would recommend it to anyone new to Linux."
3607,2023-07-20, Manjaro Linux, stable,1,1,"What Manjaro is attempting to do is make Arch easier to install and manage for newbies, but it has problems with stability. I believe this is due to its choice to use custom repositories instead of the official ones, so unlike official Arch where bugs and security issues are fixed in a timely manner, packages in Manjaro are managed differently. Often you'll have to wait for a long time before bugs are fixed, just like it used to happen to me when using Debian. So what can I say, I have moved on to pure Arch and its been a stable experience with a very comparable install, on the same laptop."

Some time ago, installed on newer hardware ( Ryzen) for a person who had never had contact with any Linux, and it helped her forget about Windows without any problems. Truly great distro and very eye-friendly themes and wallpapers."

Fedora for the most of the time.2. Pop!OS3. Debian.4. Mint5. Arch.6. UbuntuI always found some program that didn't work on this distro or that distro so arch based distros were great cause AUR.But I disliked the instability issues I had with straight from Arch repos.I read not the best things about manjaro with certs expiring etc.. But i thought, why the hell not give it a go.The held back packages seem to be working a treat if not just a peace of mind.Highly recommended if you are interested in a distro that has quick response, fast updates and is more extensively tested before packages are release. obviously always check what you are installing before you install it, but it is an extra peace of mind knowing they are more extensively tested.I saw someone post a screenshot of the filesystem creation of 2013 and they are still running Manjaro, had to fix their system a few times but they claimed it was from their own mistakes.BTRFS + Backup before tweaking, you should be good.

Manjaro used to be stable and a system you can trust would keep working without any worries, however, I keep getting breaks in the system on different computers I install to. I tried on my main desktop and a laptop I had lying around and both at one point just fails one way or another. For one thing, the desktop had a weird error with kernel modules missing?? I have an external wifi receiver that needs the 88x2bu kernel module for it to work and it failed to install for some reason and even updating the kernel was with errors. There's also the occasional weird live usb experience you get when you boot it up enough times, all the pacman mirrors returns an error and you cannot temporarily install packages for tools or anything. They polished the UI a lot over the years but the underlying system inside can't keep up it seems. I can see why Endeavor has claimed the throne as #1 Arch distro. On Endeavour, even the 88x2bu module is loaded by default so that I can actually connect to wifi for the install process. I don't think I'll come back to Manjaro after this one.

The Ubuntu install almost got it. Then I tried a Manjaro KDE install.   Manjaro detected the existing Windows partition and offer a menu option to install to another partition.  All other Linux distros I tried simply wanted to grab the entire storage device. Ubuntu had a menu selection to co-install, but it seemed to have trouble with the Veracrypt encrypted Windows.  Sure, you can manually set this up in the partitioning menu. Anyway, the Manjaro installer got the GRUB all properly set for the Veracrypted Windows.  Once Manjaro is installed, the Manjaro GRUB menu is encrypted so to boot Manjaro it's one password and your booted. To boot Windows, you need to enter the Linux encryption password to get to the GRUB menu, select Windows and then enter the Veracrypt password when prompted.  I set both passwords are the same for me.

Manjaro is simple, straightforward and easy to understand, without the usual configuration headaches that go along with a Linux installation.You don't need to be a master of Arch to use an Arch-like distro.

It ran my bluetooth better, it allows flatpacks and AUR with a click and all the packages are several versions ahead of the others. I have tried manjaro before but it really is the best now.I usually use Arch but after installing and tyring to get the wayland to use may GPU card for hours and then Bluetooth for hours, for what? to try to get is as good as manjaro?"
3621,2023-05-22, Manjaro Linux, stable,10,26,"As a total noob in Linux land, I can say that I'm surprised about how polished this distro feels. I run Manjaro KDE on a 10 year old laptop whiteout any problems. Updating goes fine here, despite some reactions from other users who had problems. It rather feels kinda boring because I haven't got any trouble, lol. Couldn't say that from WIN...RAM consumption is low and most of the packages are pre-installed. Installing additional packages is easy with pamac GUI.My laptop only uses intel graphics which works well out of the box. For people who are scared of a rolling release version and the ""Arch-thing"", I would advice waiting a day or two to perform the update, after the update appears on your screen. Or read the forum announcement about the update.You have haters and lovers, but I think Manjaro is a great distro for all sorts of people. Beginner and longtime users. Especially the KDE version. I think it is the most polished one from all distro's but that's my opinion.My 2 cents"

3623,2023-05-21, Manjaro Linux, 22.1.1,10,4,"Manjaro Linux is a popular Linux distribution that offers many advantages. One of its main positive points is its ease of use. Thanks to its user-friendly installer and intuitive user interface, even computer novices can adopt it without much difficulty. In addition, Manjaro Linux benefits from an active community that provides excellent support and regular updates, ensuring system stability and security.Another major advantage of Manjaro Linux is its compatibility with many software applications. It benefits from an extensive software repository, which makes it easy to install and update applications. In addition, through its use of the XFCE, KDE Plasma or GNOME desktop environment, Manjaro Linux offers an elegant and customizable interface, thus meeting the needs and preferences of each user.However, despite its many advantages, Manjaro Linux also has a few drawbacks. First, due to its Arch Linux-based nature, it can sometimes be unstable or experience hardware compatibility issues. While the Manjaro community is working hard to resolve these issues, it is important to note that this distribution may not be suitable for users looking for an extremely stable and reliable solution.In addition, although Manjaro Linux offers a wide selection of software, there may be delays in the availability of the latest versions of applications. Therefore, if you need to access the latest features or work with specific software, you may need to look for alternative solutions or seek to install the desired software using other methods.In conclusion, Manjaro Linux is a user-friendly and powerful Linux distribution, suitable for beginners and advanced users alike. Its ease of use, active community and wide range of software make it an attractive choice for many users. However, it is important to keep in mind possible stability and hardware compatibility issues as well as possible delays in the availability of the latest software versions."
3624,2023-05-13, Manjaro Linux, stable,4,0,"As an end user, my experience with Manjaro was unfortunately negative. The installation process was initially smooth, but once I started to configure the system, I found it to be quite frustrating. I encountered numerous device incompatibilities that made it difficult to get things working properly. For example, my graphics card was not supported, and I had to manually install the drivers, which was a time-consuming process.Furthermore, I ran into numerous software bugs that made the user experience less than optimal. I frequently encountered crashes and freezes, and some applications did not work at all. I also experienced broken packages that caused issues with the system's stability.Another problem I faced was that Manjaro's repository was not always in sync with Arch's. This made it difficult to install some packages that were available in the Arch repositories, but not in Manjaro's. Overall, while Manjaro has some appealing features, my experience with it was frustrating due to the various device incompatibilities, software bugs, and package management issues that I encountered."

As always nice user experience.In this update there were generated  3 .pacnew  files (pacman.conf, pamac.conf, grub) there was nothing serious, for grub was added `show submodules` optionfor pamac new option `to install updates without internet connection`and for pacman  2 options `ilovecandy` and `parallel downloads`.user can safely ignore .pacnew files, or to merge them with her configuration.other than that, as always all the packages were updated to latest versions.So review:IMHO MATE is the best desktop, and Manjaro packages & configures it well, the themes are nice (both Matcha-Dark & Matcha-Light) the settings apps are good, you have `MATE Tweak` and qt tweaker among other thingsAnd Manjaro tools are good:- you can choose to keep linux 6.1 LTS kernel or switch to latest 6.2  with `manjaro kernels manager`- you can install additional language packs for Firefox, Thunderbird & Libreofffice  with `manjaro language packs manager`it is nice.Also bluetooth widget is configured for you and switched off  (yes EndeavourOS you are weird not to do this)And `Pamac` is very cool thing.`Pamac` has a nice GUI app which manages packages for you, it is easy to use, and you can enable AUR if you want.Then `Pamac` GUI can be used to install packages from AUR, which is cool.Also it is possible to install 2 plugins for pamac  (libpamac-snap-plugin, libpamac-flatpak-plugin)And if you do, then pamac will become a GUI for pacman, aur, snap, flatpak  - WHICH IS VERY cool.Also pamac has a CLI  with nice apt like interfaceso instead of `sudo pacman -Syu` you can write in pamac `sudo pamac upgrade` which is very easy.cause pacman by default is cryptic.SO manjaro is doing everything right... and Manjaro MATE edition is very easy to use and performant,you don't need to waste time to polish MATE like you need to do with XFCE, and MATE is still lightweight so it is a win win to use Manjaro MATE instead of Manjaro XFCE for this reason.Pros:-easy to use-lightweight-the best desktop experience on linux (IMHO, been using it for 17 years, hate GNOME 3+ redesign, don't like KDE complexity & bugginess, don't like mac desktop -> SO MATE)-it is full featured desktop (no need to waste time like in Manjaro XFCE to configure it if you want good && at the same time lightweight desktop)-the default apps in MATE are cool, and have a lot of features. (they are much better than gnome ones, and better than XFCE ones)- MATE file manager(`Caja` is much better, than Gnome file manager `Nautilus` -> which was designed for idiots in mind with its feature removal and redesigns between the versions)Cons:-Mate is developed in a very `tranquilo` chilling way.-cause of that wayland support is long time ahead-wayland features are half implemented  (but still MATE is deskop number 3 in this aspect  after Gnome & KDE. XFCE for example only started wayland root for some apps. Other desktops are simply ignoring Wayland)- A huge amout of functionality is done in Compiz, which isn't packaged by default-Build in manager Marco is very simplistic and lacks features such as zoom."

As I expected, this was not my experience. There also is no such thing in the world of Arch. You should know something about Arch to use Arch and arm yourself with the amount of constant maintaining required.I use to be one that would install something and accept the challenge of its shortcomings. These days, I just want to install it and use it. No customization. No overhauling of any type. So is stick with Kubuntu.I do like to check things out though from time to time.

3630,2023-04-22, Manjaro Linux, 22.1.0,3,0,"HiI installed Manjaro (KDE Plasma version) because it is a distribution that is very popular in forums and other linuxian discussion places. I admit that it is attractive on several points, including the ease of installation and the pre-installed software package that satisfies the most common needs. I tested it after a resident installation on an external hard drive (Seagate), but I gave up after a few days because my bash scripts don't work properly even though I changed the shell as it should be since zsh is active by default in Manjaro. Some will argue that zsh is more this or more that, it doesn't matter, for me, as far as Manjaro is concerned the result is the same with zsh, sh or bash: zero.I use a dual boot Windows 10 / Mint 20.3 machine where my scripts work perfectly. Same thing on 2 other laptops also equipped with Windows / Mint 21 for one of them and Windows / Mint 21.1 for the other.Finally, on my ""reference machine"" equipped with 4 OS: Mint 21.1 / Siduction / Garuda Raptor Dr460nized and Windows 10 (which is rotting quietly because I haven't set foot on it for years), all my bash scripts work without any problem. On this point Manjaro is out of order and I don't have the time or the desire to play around with the possible assembly bullshit of the distribution. So, ciao Manjaro, I'm ""changing cremerie"". Instead, I installed MX-Linux (also in KDE version), and although the software package is a bit messy and overcrowded, MX is a very responsive Linux in all uses and responds correctly to my scripts.In short: whether it's Debian, Arch or Ubuntu/Mint, the job is done EXCEPT with Manjaro. Look for the error... if you feel like it."

I also use flash drives every day which are formatted as FAT32 file systems. For some odd reason Manjaro would not mount any of my flash drives but gave the error that ""filesystem type vfat"" was invalid. I also received this same error with Alma Linux but not with Rocky Linux! I really don't have time to scour the Internet to resolve errors like this which is ludicrous. I want something that ""just works""! So once again Manjaro bites the dust!     "

I want my PC  to work without  permanently paying attention, as it is required by Arch or Endeavour.So I went back to Manjaro KDE and was impressed:Well designed and immaculate hardware recognition. Even the driver for my stone age nvidia card was correctly identified and installed out of the box. None of  the many distributions I have tried has been able to pull that one off so far.Manjaro is by far the most pleasant solution for someone who wants to experience whats coming up near the edge of development, without wasting too much time with maintenance.For daily productive use Debian stable is always my main OS, though."
3633,2023-03-30, Manjaro Linux, stable,3,0,"There is no real advantage behind using Manjaro over Arch. In fact, Arch is far more stable, has an exceedingly reliable management and software developer team who take accountability for their distribution. Manjaro on the other hand, while it does make installing the system easier, they do unfortunately have a very casual attitude towards the problems their users face. They don't take it seriously enough. I am not a Manjaro user anymore, I quit using it many years ago because contrary to popular opinion, I found it quite buggy and their forums did not address any of my issues. So I learnt how to install Arch. I was shocked at how stable Arch was, way more stable than Manjaro. I did not have to reinstall my Arch system, and ended up using it as my production machine for over 4 straight years and counting."

3635,2023-03-22, Manjaro Linux, 22.0.4,5,0,"Tried many times, but have not been able to have a long term ( 3 months plus) good experience.Most installs ended with breakages - some lasted a while, but bugs caused enough frustration to make me move.I don't understand the reason raison d'être for arch based ""user friendly"" distros.  Arch is a hobby distro - no commercial ventures use it as a base. An arch installation requires a level  of ongoing maintenance by the user that most folks are not prepared to keep up with.  So using arch as a base for an OS targeted for mainstream users just does not make sense to me. Especially now, with containerized software choices, bleeding edge applications can be enjoyed without significant risk to the system. So the only real selling point of a ""user friendly"" arch system is fading fast.Specifically, the visual customizations of the KDE spin cause bugs.  Always have and it seems to be getting worse, not better.  Gnome spin is better in this regard, but i still have to add and delete a bunch of extensions to get Gnome in my pocket, so Manjaro's tweaks offer me no real reason to use this version either. And using the AUR with Manjaro is a real risk to stability.Honest advice for new or casual Linux users: Ignore the marketing because there are more stable and less buggy distro's available than this attempt to bring Arch to the masses.  If you want the arch experience (super detailed customization being its only unique feature), take a weekend to explore, learn and play with official Arch.  If latest and greatest app versions are your thing (not poo pooing - folks like artists, videographers, graphics designers, etc. kind of require the latest app versions to execute their crafts), than Flatpak, Snap, et al will give you this on nearly any distro.My opinion is Manjoro is just not what it is marketed to be. "

Seems to break pretty seriously once or twice a year, either requiring long hours of forum-posting and troubleshooting, and/or a complete re-install. But that's Linux life, I guess. Probably better for noobs - enough training wheels to ease you into things, but they come off easy enough. Still, I think maybe I've outgrown it. I don't mind tinkering when I feel like tinkering, but having to chase down weird problems when they pop up is a pain. Some of that could just be Gnome, too. God only knows what they're smoking over there.The Arch base makes info pretty easy to find. Lots of useful, niche software in the AUR you won't/can't find anywhere else.All in all, I got no complaints."
3637,2023-03-21, Manjaro Linux, stable,1,1,It seems to me that every version of Manjaro KDE is getting worse and worse.  Some problems go unaddressed from one version to the next even when you bring it to their attention. That's unexcusable!  Especially buggy is the Pacman software application.  I used to love Manjaro but I now think it's a shaddow of what it was in the past. Yes it's a great looking distro and I love the rolling release but the instability and unresolved problems I was seeing were enough for me to wipe it from the SSD.  Hopefully the Manjaro people fixes these problems in Plasma 5.27.  Stay clear of this version unless you enjoy nagging problems.

Debian's live iso could not even recognize my laptop's gpu [Radeon] and wifi adapter [Intel].The Manjaro's kernel [6.1.19] recognized all devices except the ELAN fingerprint reader.The user experience is very mature similar to a Chromebook, Windows or MacOS device.Snap apps like authy also work as normal, unlike MX Linux. And Gnome also has vpn connection extensions for wireguard and tailscale.Some minor cons: the installer cannot define btrfs subvolumes like / and /home. Although there is a minimal install, the iso is still quite large. more than 3GB. TLP power mgmt is not installed by default, thus my laptop did not run in powersave mode.

3642,2023-03-03, Manjaro Linux, stable,7,4,"Manjaro is a relatively easy distro to break into the Arch Linux space, and does a great job at getting you up and running with minimal effort. The KDE spin is very close to stock, but with some tasteful additions like Yakuake (a dropdown terminal activated with F12) to make CLI tools accessible wherever you are in the system.Manjaro also features some great integration of the AUR/Pacman repositories within the KDE Discover app, along with Flatpaks. It really does a good job at integrating KDE with Arch :) My personal downsides come from how a lot of the necessary development packages I needed to get VSCode and Flutter dev running on my system (such as CMake) weren't easily available without accessing the AUR. The keychain system used by Pacman/AUR was also a bit of a pain but I think this isn't a widespread issue.I personally don't think the AUR should be the fallback for important tools for developers, which increases the chance of a supply chain attack or generally poorly maintained repackaged software. This along with some other security concerns with how the Manjaro project is managed lead me to eventually moving to KDE-Neon.That being said, I know that this isn't going to be a gamebreaker for most people, and I wouldn't write it off if you wanted to game using Manjaro, or even do dev work if you don't mind using the AUR for dependencies.Manjaro is probably the closest Arch has come so far to being a plug-and-play distro like Ubuntu, Pop, Mint etc. but it has some ways to go in order to mature itself and restore its reputation amongst many Linux users."

Now it runs on my desktop rig, my wife's desktop rig, and three laptops in my family (though the laptops are used only occasionally). Doesn't matter whether new or old hardware, the performance of the system meets the needs of the respective user. No system crashes ever. Neither tricky popup windows for forced OS version update, nor system updates at the most incovenient time (yes, M$, I'm looking at you). Manjaro just works and in doing so, it leaves my space intact.I'm not a tech guru or IT wizard, just an everyday user. But I've never seen a printer installation so easy than with my old (7 years old back then) Samsung multifunctional printer. Plugged it in, and it immediatelly worked, including scanning functions as well. (Yeah, I know, it's Linux feature, not Manjaro. Still.)Regarding graphics drivers: tried with nVidia GTX 750 and GTX 1050 Ti (with proprietary driver) and AMD RX 580 graphics (with open source driver) as well: flawless operations in all cases for at least one year.The only problem I had was using snap packages. Snap is something I can live without though and to be honest, I haven't tried any snap installation in the last 1.5 years. It was simply unnecessary."

The Excellent Hardware and Software support (AUR) and big commiunity are additional benefits. I like Manjaro more then any ohter dist or windows now.

I'm not a power user, but I've been using Linux for at least a dozen years. This is the only distro I've had problems with trying to install my Brother printer. Tried many suggestion found online but nothing worked. My printer driver was in the arch repositories. I installed it, but it still didn't work. Oh well, back to Debian."

I don't even want to use Windows after this.Personally, KDE Plasma is the best desktop for daily driving this distro, purely because of the high levels of customization that are possible. I am actively running Manjaro on my Framework laptop, and no driver hunting was necessary (aside from goodix fingerprint reader).

3665,2023-07-10, Linux From Scratch, 11.3-BLFS,10,1,"
I've been using LFS since version 10.0 (9/2020). It was and continues to be a great teaching tool for me. First, you download all the souce code from the individual developers onto your host OS  (one wget command). Then you partition, setup a file system, and start compiling. First you build the tool chain, then you build all the components of the system itself. The first time, it may take a day to understand and follow all instructions. After that, less than a day. There is even an automation tool to automatically build, which can make a bootable system in a few hours.Then comes the real fun, ""Beyond Linux From Scratch"" (BLFS). This is all the extras you might need. Desktop environments like Gnome, XFCE, KDE. Web browsers, LibreOffice, Transmission, too many to name. As full-featured as most distros out there (except the package management system). And if your package is not available. The knowledge you have acquired in building the system will allow you to build almost any open source software. Be the ruler of your desktop! As with any system, just be sure to back up. I use Timeshift, which is not included, but is a simple build.Pros:- Learn a lot. Learn to install almost anything from souce code.- Make the system you want, not someone else- Choice of systemd or SysV- Hundreds of packages to choose from- Always being updated (quick security notifications, updates and patches)- Automated system works on LFS and BLFS- Great for learning to configure and build kernels.- Rewarding feeling knowing you compiled everything.Cons:- Can be time consuming, but not that bad after you get to the desktop stage, IMO. Go get a coffee.- No package management, although some people have devised management systems.- When new, incompatible glibc updates come out (about once a year or less), most people will just start over.- Some people don't care to learn- Rarely, the development branch won't build because of incompatibilities among components. "
3666,2022-03-31, Linux From Scratch, 11.1,9,13,"Very good for education but when it comes to package management, even though some techniques are shared, you'll probably end up forking Portage or Pacman. Having that in mind, you might want to check the Gentoo or Arch Linux route. Yes you can create your own repositories with your own package manager but A LOT OF WORK is already done with Arch by the fact that the pre-compiled binaries are also tested by many people. As for gentoo, there's plenty of ebuilds that exist already and have been proven to be solid. There's no limit to how far you can go but I think it's a better thing for the Linux world to strengthen what's already available out there. My suggestions to the people behind LFS would be to teach people how to make immutable OS such as Nixos or how to manage your distro so that when you update your system, it acts as swupd which only gets the changed portion of software leading for faster updates.  I give LFS a good 9 out of 10"

A real enterprise OS. Not for those who want a Windows like system, If you want that there are multiple Linux distributions available that will do everything for you.If it isn't available in Solaris, then do it yourself, that's what admins are supposed to do. Very secure system, and highly underrated due to the cost. It's no longer the premier OS due to Oracle scrapping all further development,  but it's more than capable of running anything companies want.Yes, I am a Solaris admin, but companies primarily want Linux so that's what I do now.

3670,2022-10-05, Oracle Solaris, 11.4,1,0,"The 2018 version (for x86) of Solaris 11.4 (straight from Oracle ISO ""text install"" image) does not properly configure the network interface (using DHCP) when booting up under VirtualBox (originally an Oracle product).  I do not really know why this fails, but honestly, I do not WANT to know why this fails!  In fairness, the Oracle latest AI type install seems to work.  Solaris was at one time a terrific OS -- especially for enterprise operations -- but it is a distant shadow of itself when the ISO of it cannot configure properly at boot-up under VirtualBox.  Very sad.The real problem is that Oracle should be making available a ""text install"" ISO image that is created from the latest builds of the OS.  This is a big outage from Oracle (as far as I am concerned)."
3671,2021-04-11, Oracle Solaris, 11.4,10,0,"I have the free DL of 11.4 on a SPARC T4-1. Pretty pure Unix. Very nice OS (although the free download is pretty old and missing lots of updates provided to license holders). Oracle is in print stating Solaris will be supported until 2034(36?) *That* is how you support mission critical software. But a license is some value of ""a lot"", and a full & free release of Solaris at 'current' by Mr. Ellison is very unlikely. For X86 look at OmniOS. It's also very nice if you know what ""gmake"" means, and it's kept up. I trust it. Linux is a relentless drive towards The New. Solaris isn't for those people, but you have to have the dosh.

3685,2021-12-06, ROSA, 12,9,22,ROSA linux is an easy-to-use system for the whole family. The system runs fast and is well tuned.
3686,2021-11-24, ROSA, 12,10,48,"In my opinion, Rosa is THE successor to Mandriva. I’ve tried Mageia and OpenMandriva and they didn’t work well for me whereas Rosa has the tried and true Mandriva tools, better stability, is speedier, looks better, has a lot more customization and better ease of use. There are also more repositories to add even more customization and other programs. NVIDIA drivers work right out of the box too! I haven’t had any problems when using Rosa. I recommend it."
3687,2021-10-31, ROSA, R11,10,32,"Xeon 16 gig NVME If you are looking for something conservative and more consistently stable and reliable than anything else out there, Rosa is your game. It rivals historic Debian for being slow to update and does so only when everything has been tested and retested to not cause a problem. In spite of that it does have a lot of core system programs quite up to date and the browsers are up to date. I have always been a fan of KDE-4 and to me nothing else rivals it's clean elegance. Amazingly, core KDE-4 system files were regularly updated even though KDE supposedly stopped supporting it years ago. I'm sad to see it and 32 bit dropped in Version 12  but understand. The Mandriva GUI tools make this a great distro for new Linux users. I can't think of a single time I had to go to the command line to do anything. Rosa is truly an install and forget about it distro! The user is not overwhelmed by constant huge updates which makes this a good distro for those with poor or slow internet access. For version 12 I was glad to see that the traditional Rosa theme for the taskbar and the Gnome style ""Simple"" launcher were not applied by default. But, this is Linux so there are choices to suite everyone. I have always found Rosa fast and responsive to use. Boot up is fast too. If you look at the average user rating, 9.06 that puts it into 4th or 5th most highly rated distro out there! You don't get there by careless rushed work! I have no plans to replace this Rosa 11 KDE-4 installation with anything else. "
3688,2021-10-23, ROSA, 12,10,27,"This is a great Mandriva-based distro, it works a lot better for me than Mageia has- that has been slow to respond for applications to open and wasn’t as intuitive compared to Rosa. Rosa is easy to use and configure, I was able to easily install NVIDIA graphics drivers too. It also has the tools from Mandriva, compared to other Mandriva-based distros that don’t, so it’s less of a learning curve using Rosa.Overall, Rosa has been working great for me."

The latest ISO works fine.I think this distribution is really nice. Unlike what the other reviewer says, EPEL works correctly.I am moving from CentOS to Navy Linux. It needs more contributions from the community compared to Alma and Rocky: Navy does not have nearly as much money nor manpower backing it.It seems to be what it says to be."
3693,2021-09-22, Navy Linux, 8.4,1,0,"Version 8.4 was released as release version, however a hotfix was published recently named 8.4r1.The 8.4r1 release version disk image is updated often without incrementing version name, causing a lot of confusion. The reason of these updates is that all the claimed features that were supposed to be shipped on release are not actually shipped: for example, usb media created with the released image do not actually work, therefore installing a working copy of navy linux is not possible.With a lot of hacking, the system can be installed, sort of. EPEL seems to work but then I am confused on what the SERL is, all that is known is that it is an alternative with less packages and no maintainers. Because I read on Slack that the team is going to focus on minimal hardware requirements and hardened kernel in the future, I assume SERL should contain ""safer"" packages while still being community-supported instead of being supported by the Navy foundation, somehow.The project members speak english but barely, trying to understand each other seems difficult. The chat system utilized is Slack and it seems to be littered with trolls.I want to see Navy succeed. They seem to actually want to make something a little bit different compared to the mainstream Rocky and Alma, while still offering a CentOS alternative. However, the communication issues should be addressed and minimal documentation should be written so that somebody else in the community could complete it. As it is, I can't find any way for somebody to start contributing with packages nor documentation.I do not like the branding at all and a google search reveals that I am not alone with this thought."

I use it on a low-end chromebook, it is amazingly fast. First you need to put your chromebook in developer mode. Then you need to install the proper firmware to boot UEFI (follow instructions from mrchromebox.tech). Etch the ISO on a USB thumb drive and you can boot puppy (when booting, press CTRL-L to enter into the bios, insert the USB thumb drive, select it to boot).You then have a fairly complete OS sitting completely in RAM, no need to install it or to set up dual-boot. The pre-installed utilities are sufficient for most tasks and extremely light. The look-and-feel is a bit old-school, but straightforward. You can install the browser of your choice (there is a menu entry for that), and install a couple of command-line tools you need using the package manager. You can even install LibreOffice if you want to, although the antique Abiword might be sufficient to draft simple memos. The packages are pulled from the Slackware repositories on this version. There also exist Ubuntu-based versions of puppy linux, which are also good. It is just a matter of choice, the latest Ubuntu version containes just a bit more applications (look for the F96 version).Puppy is different from other distributions as it runs in root. This is not an issue since the ISO is not corruptible and you could just reboot if needed. Also, it is a distribution for single users. For safer web browsing, there is a restricted ""spot"" user you can configure in the startup menu.For chromebook, you may want to delete the file etc\acpi\actions\suspend.sh, which makes the laptop reboot instead of suspend, for example if you close the lid.Since it runs completely in RAM, it is amazingly fast. If you turn off the laptop, it leaves no trace on the laptop. In my case, I can still use the chromebook for family purposes. Also, it is very efficient from the power consumption standpoint, in my case providing 8 hours or more of operation.I have tried several lightweight distributions, this one is the most efficient and complete in my opinion.  "
3697,2023-06-24, Puppy Linux, 9.5,9,6,"Am running debian on 2 laptops, arch for my ""gamer rig"", and 3 laptops from the 2000s (thinkpads, of course) with puppy. Xenial, Fossa and bionic pups, however I've also tried slackware and tahr pups. Been using linux since 2020. Will admit it took a good while to figure out how to use puppy os. Spent some hours troubleshooting for my unique needs. Ended up using puppy daily for browsing (after figuring out how to update firefox, that's the first thing I suggest you do, don't bother using any other browsers it comes with, as it is quite effort to get them up to date), word processing for school work, pdf reading, video/movie watching, emulating psx games, etc. Due to how puppy is set up, I have both been able to use it on days I did not want  to bother tinkering and wanted to use my laptops casually, but I've also been able to troubleshoot and learn a lot about PCs/linux in the process, making it easier for me to understand and use debian when I needed to do more tech savvy things on other PCs. The repos aren't too up to date, so you won't get every niche program you crave, but you still get most of the basics. Don't expect telegram, element, spotify, etc. internet based software to work unless you really want to go through a lot of steps, and have an annoying time keeping them up to date. The effort wasn't worth it for me. They say the installer is hard, but as a noob, I was able to figure it out by following a couple tutorials at the same time. Not that daunting. It is an OS very not likely to ever break, since essencially, it never receives any updates, aside bug fixes. It's made me realize that I really don't need the latest featues, aside keeping my firefox up to date. Which is easy enough to do. It has brought new life into my 2gb to 4gb laptops, making them feel like new. I can have a lot of tabs open at once, or worst case scenario, run 1 video with 5 text based tabs open, on a laptop with just 2gb of RAM. It feels as fast as when I first got these archaic laptops back in the day when I was a kid. I see myself in the future always having a 2nd laptop running puppy os, since the experience is pleasant once you've taken the time to familiarize and learn how to use it correctly. Easy options during install to set everything to run as root, no need for logins at boot, no need to worry about updates, nor anything breaking, etc. If you do anything risky, you can setup so that sessions are not saved before you reboot. I can see myself using this distro for the rest of my life on cheap 2gb RAM travel sized laptops, or second hand ones, when I don't need my debian PCs. Wacom tablets run excellent on puppy, if you don't mind using an ancient version of krita, of course. Was more effort to setup my huion tablet though.Overall, great niche distro for oddball people like myself. I started using puppy to revive a few pre-historic laptops that were gifted to me, thinking it'd be a temporary OS for me until these current laptops pass away, to now seeing myself using puppy for many years to come, assuming this project never gets abandoned. My favorite experience as of writing this has been with fossapup."

For home users (I am not sure how IBM MQ and IBM ACE would work on a puppy on a Puppy system)  Puppy has a lot of merit.  It is blazingly fast like SliTaz and Porteus and far easier to configure.  Like Porteu,Puppy has its own way of doing things, it is not standard Linux, so a little learning is in order, but damn it is fast and light.I am not sure why there was such a spread between free, top,and htop in terms of memory but with the firewall running it was using 193 MB via free -m and top and around 300 MB via htop.  Did I say it is fast? I clicked ongnumeric and the spreadsheet was up as my finger came off the key,Palemoon was up quickly playing a youtube video and total RAM burned was only 512 MB via htop.  Fastest opening for images or playing downloaded videos I have yet seen.Lots of apps, very, very fast, an easy to navigate, intuitive desktop (reminds me of Q4OS), great set-up utilities (set up wifi).   For homeusers who just want to surf the net, read e-mails, watch youtube, run a spreadsheet and do word processing this is a winner.   A great distro.Interestingly, the Puppy forum gives great support, on par with Mint for responsiveness.

3701,2023-05-25, Puppy Linux, 9.5,2,6,"It was nice years ago, when computers hasn't got nowadays power.- Today it is fixed in the past.All of us know that Puppy Linux is a lightweight and minimalist Linux distribution that is designed to run on older or low-spec hardware. While Puppy Linux can be useful in certain situations, there are a few reasons why it may not be recommended for everyone:Limited package availability: Puppy Linux uses its own package manager called ""PET"" (Puppy Package Manager) and doesn't have access to the wide range of software available in mainstream Linux distributions. This can make it challenging to find and install certain applications or libraries that you may need.Less community support: Puppy Linux has a smaller user base compared to popular Linux distributions like Ubuntu or Fedora. As a result, there may be fewer online resources, forums, or community support available when you encounter issues or need help with troubleshooting.Lack of long-term support: Puppy Linux follows a different release model compared to many mainstream distributions. Instead of regular long-term support (LTS) releases, Puppy Linux tends to have more frequent updates and releases. This can make it more difficult to rely on Puppy Linux for long-term stability and security updates.Steeper learning curve: While Puppy Linux is known for its simplicity and ease of use, it still requires some technical knowledge and familiarity with Linux. If you are new to Linux or prefer a more user-friendly experience, other distributions like Ubuntu or Linux Mint may be more suitable.Hardware compatibility issues: Puppy Linux may not always work out of the box with all hardware configurations. Due to its lightweight nature, certain hardware components or drivers may not be supported, requiring additional configuration or troubleshooting to get them working properly.Ultimately, whether Puppy Linux is suitable for you depends on your specific needs and requirements. If you have older hardware or prefer a minimalist Linux distribution, Puppy Linux can be a viable option. However, if you require extensive software availability, long-term support, or a larger community for support, you may want to consider other mainstream Linux distributions."

If you ""try"" a package and don't like it, sometimes removing it through the package manager will break dependencies or won't allow it to be uninstalled due to now required dependencies.  Some packages then introduce multiple versions of libraries that can't be removed for the previous reason.Confusing information about the version being used, in regards to setting up or fixing.Sometimes with in the same version, the guiding information windows conflict with a previous message (think running web browsers as Spot choices at the beginning, but you have to add Firefox later which then comes in without Spot).  You have to be a knowledgeable Linux admin or ask the community.The community buries the knowledge in the forums and you have to hunt.Not all provided packages actually work (think battery monitor that doesn't refresh)Setting preferences can be a chore (Hint: make your own theme and save the changes first, then apply it).  JVM is fiddly.Linux kernels may appear to some to be outdated, but fit for the time period of origination (32-bit UBB is kernel 4.9...)  I'm not sure how kernel security updates are handled with older but still currently offered Puppy versions.Overall, make a base system and a backup on the side to quickly recover from before a package install.  Once you get a base system set up, keep that copy.  Keep the idea of its use simple for old machines; a more modern machine should probably use a larger system to take easy advantage of the current hardware available.  In other words, I wouldn't buy a computer to put Puppy on but would put it on a secondary older machine with limited purposes in mind.  Keep expectations low, and Puppy versions are a great option."
3718,2022-03-23, Puppy Linux, 9.5,8,6,"I'm not exactly a newbie, but haven't installed anything new in Linux for at least 8 years.  I'd like a new version of Puppy and am finding it hard to navigate all the operations one has to do to get the thing installed.  I read about unetbootin, but am not sure how safe it is given where the program would be downloaded from.  I like the speed and security that Puppy provides, you can carry it around with you on a flash drive if you are traveling and comes with a lot of utilities already installed.I've used both Ubuntu and Mint for decades as they come from their downloads.  However, installing Puppy still requires a good working knowledge of how to manage the ""terminal"" operations one has to perform and I fear making some kind of dreadful error while attempting to get it downloaded.   I reformatted my former version of Puppy on the flash drive but for some reason the file system is still msdos even though I've chosen Fat32 repeatedly.  In one place my laptop tells me it is msdos while in another it is Fat32.  Who do I believe?While viewing the file system on our older Puppy drive (5.7) from years ago, just locating the more used applications like internet and mail were difficult.  It would be nice to have the program set up with the major things people use Puppy for the most would be right there in front of your nose as icons on the desktop.  If there is a selector engine, that could be there first that one could put away somewhere once all your selections have been made.  I find the default font and icon size are too small and some of them give you no idea what on earth they are for.I think it would be wonderful if the most used programs like Ubuntu, Mint and Puppy could be made in packages that the novice user could easily install without all the intimidating ""terminal"" stuff.  There could be a download site where after you get your flash drive set up, all you have to do is hit the button and there it is waiting for you.  Even if it was the most generic version, the tough stuff would be behind you and all you'd have to do is personalize it and perhaps download a few packages."

Case in point, Mullvad would not work correctly on version BionicPup 8.0 because of the old Linux kernel.

After copying files from live iso to my puppy partition i expected to set up a user and a password but i didn't get that kind of option so you'll have to use this puppy as root always. About the much advertised lightweight features of puppy i can tell you it's not quite the case as it uses over 500 mb memory without starting anything while artix linux uses with xfce only 270mb. As a bonus point puppy allows you to choose f2fs filesystem which is very good for usb sticks and ssd. For the graphical part i can't say much but is rather ugly it's true it's minimalist but slax is minimalist too and looks better.

So downloaded another ISO image and re-installed. Seems to be stable, but all applications are glacially slow. The QT development tools all had 1 to 6 sec delays (where nothing happens) before a project could be loaded and edited and other such nonsense. My SCons build system is no longer usable because I designed it with dead-man switches where a time-out at strategic places stops the build for failed code. As I type this review, I am one or two key-strokes ahead before anything shows in the text box.I have always liked previous versions of the Absolute distro for its cleanness and responsiveness on both old and new machines, and for the selection of included applications, and for the well-designed add-on utilities written by Mr. Sherman. But much of that is broken or untenable with version 15; which is almost unusable. Not that it matters to me, but my niece noticed that some of the applications on the main menu have no corresponding program installed.

3752,2023-07-21, OpenBSD, 7.3,10,16,"
What I love about OpenBSD the most is the first party tools it comes with by default, which makes it super easy to set up a server from the ground up, super easy to make it act like a military-grade secure router that can be accessed from all over the world by you and only you, and the fine balance between doing certain things for you and staying out of your way.The default install uses no more than 16 mebibytes of RAM, which is quite a difference from 97 mebibytes on Crux, 300 on Void, 600 on Artix, 800 on Debian, and pretty much everything on FreeBSD (but it does that for performance reasons).I'm running OpenBSD as a server OS on almost all my servers, the only exceptions are those that require something like a Rust or NodeJS compiler, in that case I opt for FreeBSD.But on desktops I much rather prefer Linux instead.I see other people saying that FreeBSD has the upperhand on desktops over OpenBSD, but I actually beg to differ.The other day, I installed FreeBSD on a ThinkPad, and closing the lid won't put it to sleep mode, even after configuring to do so it wouldn't do so.OpenBSD on the other hand, works out of the box.WiFi is a similar thing, OpenBSD works straight away whereas on FreeBSD it doesn't.And even if it doesn't work on OpenBSD (because your WiFi card uses a proprietary driver), they provide a tool to easily install the required drivers post installation.And upgrading the OS is just a matter of running ""sysupgrade"", which is so much smoother than FreeBSD's ""freebsd-update fetch && freebsd-update install"".However, when it comes to packages, FreeBSD is better, because it has a much larger packages, packages are far more up to date, package manager is blazingly fast, and the ports let you customize just about anything, which are things I really miss on OpenBSD.So FreeBSD vs OpenBSD comes down to usecase.Do you run an internet facing server? OpenBSDDo you run a NAS? FreeBSDDo you run a desktop? Linux"
3753,2023-07-12, OpenBSD, 7.3,6,0,"installation is not as easy as other distributions, such as FreeBSD. The manual is not as explanatory as others I have seen, in this aspect, FreeBSD is also superior. I've read everything but I couldn't get the sound to work. Everything was mute. For everything it offers, it seems good for a server, but for desktop it still lacks a lot. As a positive point, the system resources are minimal, it uses very little memory and does not install unnecessary pacotes. Then, I came to the conclusion that for those who want a minimalist system, which uses little system resources, it could be good, as long as it manages to solve problems like this audio. I'll stick with FreeBSD, maybe it's not so sure, but it has its advantages and it's going great."
3754,2023-07-03, OpenBSD, 7.3,10,51,"OpenBSD has the upper advantage over GNU/Linux nowadays when it comes to open-source controversies like Systemd, Wayland, PipeWire, and Rust. Being entirely focused on code correctness (instead of political correctness), I have a feeling that OpenBSD is the way one should go. With the current state of GNU/Linux in jeopardy (especially corporate-run distros like Ubuntu and Fedora), it makes sense to want to branch out to things like Debian, Arch GNU/Linux, Gentoo, or even Slackware (the most Unix-like distro), but what if you could do even better than that by looking into one of the *BSD systems? FreeBSD is readily accessible to those who want a Linux-familiar environment with plenty more packages ported over (including multilib approaches like Wine for your Windows programs), but it misses the point entirely: that we should aim to restore sanity to what ""sane defaults"" should entail. Wanting your system to be ""just like Windows"" certainly defeats the point of even using open-source OSes like GNU/Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, etc.Now, it should be clear here that the *BSD line of OSes should not be confused as being ""distros"" of any sort -- they are, for the most part, entirely separate userlands and use their own kernels. That is unlike with GNU/Linux where the distros are simply respins of the same OS (Linux from Scratch might be a possible exception to the rule if you'd like to delve deeper than what the popular distros ""allow"" you to tinker with).Back to OpenBSD. Let's be completely honest when I say that these systems are SLOW (due to using FFS2 instead of the Ext* formats)... But, they are slow because of the security mitigations put into place by its developers. Sure, you COULD just enable SMT to cut back on the loading times a bit, but wouldn't that still defeat the purpose of using it in the first place? It's not just the speed that one should keep in mind, but not all commands are compatible with other Unix-like OSes. For example, it's possible to use Sudo (just like in good ol' GNU/Linux!) to grant root privileges to a user, but OpenBSD comes with its own in Doas, which is far more minimal and less of a security risk as a result. Most Sudo cases are what Doas aims to provide. Also, when it comes to sound, forget about things like ALSA, PulseAudio, and PipeWire, when Sndio is their own exclusive sound server, and it works reliably well with speakers, headphones, and even USB devices. Not only that, but Xorg has been replaced with an alternative called Xenocara, and things like Startx are disabled by default for security reasons (XenoDM replaces it, being based on XDM).On the desktop side, OpenBSD is still catching on. Xfce, Lumina, GNOME, MATE, and the like should be supported by simply installing their respective package(s), but they may or may not perform as well as they do on their GNU/Linux counterparts. However, this would be the perfect opportunity to test out WMs like Cwm (also from OpenBSD), FVWM, Openbox, Fluxbox, IceWM, and Window Maker. I can say for sure that as of 7.3-current, Xfce itself is running very close to how I have mine set up on my Devuan and Salix GNU/Linux systems. However, like I said, still a bit slow, even with SMT enabled on the kernel, but definitely functional enough to use on a daily basis.When it comes to driver support, prepare to be disappointed if you're an Nvidia user. AMD/ATI Radeon support is a little lacking when compared to Linux (see what I did there with dropping ""GNU""? :D), just as Intel drivers are, but they should be functional enough that you can turn it into an HTPC or a lightweight gaming machine (just don't use Nvidia at all). Speaking of gaming, there are ports of open-source games and emulators that you could install for fun on the side, although things like PCSX2 and the aforementioned Wine aren't yet available because of Multilib issues (OpenBSD doesn't have this feature yet, but should 32-bit systems lose support, then it'd be more feasible)."
3755,2023-04-16, OpenBSD, 7.3,5,0,"The wifi chip in my Lenovo laptop isn't supported by OpenBSD so I have only tried it out in VMware.The install is pretty easy, often you can rely on the default options and only hit enter to proceed. However the automatic partitioning is not optimal, as the /usr/local partition created is too small even on a 20GB drive, and gets filled upp very quickly by just installing a browser and desktop environment, In the install you have the option to get Xorg pre-configured with a basic window manager (FVWM). For a DE like Xfce to work it takes som more configuration effort however.For some reason Firefox takes several minutes to launch. Trying to stream from Youtube didn't work for me. At the beginning both the sound and video stutters. Pretty soon after the sound stops completely but the video continues to play correctly. Searching on the web for a solution to this turns up very few hits, but some people report similar problems.It's hard to know if this problem exists because of the way OpenBSD is designed, compatibility issues with VMware or that Firefox is not natively developed for the OS but a port.In the end I like OpenBSD for what it is and look forward to try it on bare metal to see it it works better there."

It is the easiest UNIX-like operating system to use on a laptop - on my Thinkpad everything works out of the box - volume buttons, setting screen brightness, audio, wifi and graphics.There is no possibility to use Nvidia graphics cards due to Nvidia's lack of cooperation when it comes to drivers and OpenBSD refuses to accept blobs.OpenBSD is not the fastest operating system, but they don't enumerate ""performance"" as their goal, so you can't complain about that.Besides, if you were supposed to buy a car - would its speed be the only factor you'd consider?OpenBSD is easy to use, it's safe and feels familiar. It is sustainable (yes, before this buzz-word became trendy) in a way you can be sure that in 10 year's time your OpenBSD experience will be the virtually the same as today.

The configuration file is more verbose and leaves less room for errors.You're probably thinking that the ""security"" in OpenBSD makes it harder to use, but it's quite the contrary. You'll see.The init program is controlled by the 'rcctl' program. The commands are similar to systemd. ""rcctl enable httpd"", ""rcctl start httpd"", ""rcctl stop httpd"" and so on."

I like the ""secure by default"" concept.  I like the unique kernel on every boot.  X11 config works fine, and uses DRI and optimised glamor driver for intel graphics.  Xephyr works, I was able to start a nested X session with fvwm as the daughter window manager.  FUSE works.  No kernel crashes so far.Some downsides - only limited filesystem support, really only FFS, I have an ext4 disk but unable to mount this r/w.  Unclear from documentation whether softdeps are recommended for use with SSD.  Appears to be no TRIM support for SSD.Ports - software collection is a bit limited compared to what is available on linux or even freebsd; for example, I had to patch vifm and compile it myself because the openbsd port is deprecated.  The Links browser works fine, but sadly firefox regularly dumps core, and chrome has a bad memory leak, I got up one morning to find chrome had grown to 13GB (on 4GB physical ram!).  But these are likely problems within the ports themselves, not in the o/s itself.Performance is not quite as snappy as FreeBSD 13 or slackware 15 alpha on the same hardware, but its perfectly usable, even on this old hardware.

It feels like you're reading the ""--help"" usage information, but as you scroll down you realize it is much more detailed than that, and it has examples covering common use cases. Check out the FAQ first, it will seem more familiar if you're used to wiki-style documentation like the Arch Linux wiki.- WiFi configuration is as simple as creating a file containing the SSID and password;- There is no systemd. I thought it would be harder to manage services without it, but I was impressed to find out it's just as simple. ""rcctl start service_name"", ""rcctl enable service_name"", ""rcctl stop service_name"". Same deal. Also, there is no journald.

Installation of Emmabuntus is nice and smooth, and is especially well thought out. Choice of Xfce and LXDE desktops right at the login can be easily selected by the user. And, Emmabuntus even has the grand parents and grand kids covered. Special need in language (such as fcitx's boshiamy input method) and codecs, are flawless included. System package management through synaptic is great too. In summary in comparison to other desktop geared distro I have ever tried , Emmabuntus is definitely among one of the best. Thanks!"

I measure a RAM usage of about 400 MB after the start - Wow! And LXDE looks cool and good, very functional and intuitive to use. In the login, LXDE is convenient to select in the drop-down menu at the top. Just give it a try!In German:Emmabuntus ist eine hervorragende Distro, weil sie Debian stabil ist, d.h. - langweilig, weil man keine Fehler oder Probleme bekommt, alles läuft wie am Schnürchen;- sicher;- keine nervigen dauernden Updates wie bei den Rolling Releases.Natürlich hätte ich auch die original DEBIAN-Distro wählen können , aber Emmbbuntüs hat einige zusätzliche Features, die mir wirklich gefallen.Ich habe übrigens in der Paketverwaltung die Desktopvariante LXDE installiert, weil sie noch resourcenschonender ist als die beiden vorinstallierten Varianten.

3785,2022-12-04, Emmabuntüs, DE4-1.02,10,12,"In my eyes very underrated Debian Linux variant, which I liked so much that I equipped my no longer quite current laptops with it. Why? 1. after startup the distribution shows a RAM consumption of 505 MB - that's really low. Linux-MX ate much more on my laptop:885 MB!2. also the change from Xfce or LxQT surface is cool. Nothing hangs and works flawlessly. 3. some purists might be annoyed by the multitude of software that is scrubbed onto the hard disk during installation - but everyone should look at this in a differentiated way. I found it positive; for example, I no longer needed to install Filezilla, VLC, Synaptic, Gimp or WINE, which were missing in other distributions. I replaced the default browser Falkon with SRWare-Iron, the sniff-free Chromium variant. However, the Software Center also offers the secure browser variants Ungoogled Chromium or LibreWolf for installation, which can be quite tricky if you are not familiar with them.The missing audio-video-codecs or fonts are easily installed by Emmabuntüs. Interesting I found the program Warpinator, which I did not know until now. So I can very quickly and easily transfer files or folders via WLAN from smartphone and PCs back and forth without using Samba.4.Security updates are automatic if you want them to be, which is very handy. MX-Linux does not offer this - on the contrary: almost every day you are annoyed with update requests with MX, with Emmabuntüs they run invisibly.In short- Emmabuntüs makes a clean and tidy impression. It just works stable - and that's all I expect from a Linux operating system. With MX I found the many setting options confusing  - it works much faster and clearer with Emmabuntüs. The French menu entries criticized in the previous versions seem to be fixed, at least I didn't see only one that bothered me, but never used. Right-clicking on the screen I still discover 4 English entries (I chose the system language German) that were not translated. It didn't bother me, but a layman might grumble about it.The plain file manager PCManFM doesn't eat many resources and like Dolphin can even split the window in two parts-cool.Otherwise it has all the features a Debian system has to offer. Anyway, I switched from MX to Emmabuntüs and so far I don't regret it. My PCs run faster and smoother. I only say - try it out! "

However, it has the famous Thinkpad input devices and a 1600x1200 TFT screen which is impressive even now, so was worth salvaging.So, after removing about an inch of dust from the internals, cleaning up the case and keyboard and adding a very specific Samsung 160GB hard disk (second hand, from eBay) as there was none present I set out to find a usable distribution.After burning Emmabuntus to a DVD it installed perfectly. No other distribution did, and I now have a usable but slow laptop under Xfce; LxQT is a little faster. Even the ancient wireless (Intel) and Bluetooth (Broadcom) work.Emmabuntus is ""large"", with a lot of pre-installed applications and two desktop environments, but that is because of its target (not just old machines, but old machines in locations with poor or no connectivity). I understand why some people have an issue with this but Debian has relatively rare updates and, given the speed of this machine, a big install followed by small updates is ideal.This distribution gets a rare 10 from me because, by test, it is perfect for what it is intended to do."

3791,2022-01-21, Emmabuntüs, DE4-1.01,10,2,This new updated package is running very well on my old (year 2004) non-PAE 32 bit Toshiba Satellite M30Notebook (single cpu). The wireless set-up was easy after OS install but not during. I have chosen LXQt forthis low power notebook which looks very nice.I like the new Firefox 91 ESR and I have tweaked it (about:config) so it will run from RAM rather than hard diskwhich has made Firefox faster with less system impact.The Suspend has been fixed which was a problem in the past and all is working perfectly. This is my go to forlow power 32 bit computers.
3792,2022-01-04, Emmabuntüs, DE4-1.00,8,0," I would give Emmabuntus an 8.5 out of 10, but there is no in between an 8 and a 9 score. Emmanbuntus is is base don Debian a very stable and of course old operating system, but with Emmabuntus the preinstalled apps are by far way to many to start out with if a beginner to Linux. I believe the beginner Linux learner will be put into an immediate case of overload just looking at all those shortcuts at the bottom of the screen.  I personally stay away from the Ubuntu OS's because of the corporation behind it. Canonical says right there in the privacy and policy that they can pull certain personal and private information every time you use their OS.  Like Chrome receives all your search and private mail history and sells your interests to advertisers, as why the reason you often see ads from searchs you did or online companies you bought from in the past. Many I have spoken with never understood why that was. Some replied it doesn't matter too them, but you can't fix stupid.    "
3793,2021-12-26, Emmabuntüs, DE3-1.04,4,7,"I appreciate the effort but I don't get it. For instance, why not just install Debian yourself? Sure, I see this DE is tweaked a little but it's not a lot. Additionally, I personally found the user interface to be really odd. For instance, some of the dock options are bazaar and not usable (i.e., fan). I tried tweaking the look of it to make it seem somewhat professional looking. I was unsuccessful. I have been using Linux for many years. This is one of the strangest distros I ever tried. Sorry Emmabuntus. I don't see the added value. Gotta pass on this one."
3794,2021-12-24, Emmabuntüs, DE4-1.00,10,0,I am not good at detailed reviews. With that being said I belive Emmabuntus is one of the best distros out there. I am very satified with how good it is. Just give it a try yourselves and you will not be disappointed.
3795,2021-12-07, Emmabuntüs, DE4-1.00,9,0,"One of my favorite distros. However, it does not play nice with Oracle VirtualBox and getting audio to pass through has been a no go for me. For Virtual Box use I stick to Linux Mint and Kubuntu. If I needed a distro to run outside of Virtual Box it than Emmabuntus would be a top choice. Also, the work they are doing to help the dis-advantaged rehab old computers in 3rd world schools is admirable."
3796,2021-11-15, Emmabuntüs, DE4-1.00,10,1,"casually wanted to try Emmabuntus after stumbling into it. Well for my surprise it did well compared to other distros which some how or rather freezes. I normally use, free conference call and libreoffice calc at the same time and also in between use Firefox. So far Emmabuntus has gained my confidence besides backbox. The worries of freezing during sessions makes one wonder if it would crash ... but so far I am very well happy with Emmabuntus. tq"
3797,2021-09-29, Emmabuntüs, DE4,8,1,"Yeah, not too bad! I tried out both the lxqt version, and the xfce version. I do very much like that you can switch between the two as easily and exactly the same way as switching between X11 & Wayland or GTK and lightdm, I don't remember if that is right but anyone with a few months or even weeks experience with Linux will understand what I am trying to say.  Warning: though it is easy to switch the two, please keep in mind that the longer you use one platform the more difficult it becomes to delete or disable the file systems, since Qt uses the pacman and xfce uses Thunar. I know there are a few more examples but that one is IMHO, the most difficult change over you will have to do. I was very surprised to learn that lxqt version is not as memory-intensive or hogging the memory as xfce. I thought that when they switched lxde to lxqt, they would see a dramatic spike in mem/cpu usage but maybe they (Emmabuntu) tweaked the two to be different.   Lastly, the difference between the general consensus of ease of installation, setup, etc., between Emma* and Debian 11 (which if everyone is not familiar, this distro is using Deb 11) is basically that Deb 11 itself is absolutely a nightmare as compared to playing in the park and swinging on a swing, etc.Neither are quite that exaggerated but you get my meaning, I hope: people all have different opinions and people tend to exaggerate or oversimplify when talking about things like this. It is all relative: I am very sure that Deb 11's setup is like the park scene if competing against an Arch or Kali setup! But to a Noob or ex-Noob making progress even, yeah, when I had installed Deb 10 over a year and a half ago, I was a Super-Noob and I was definitely in over my head. In any case, overall I liked it, and as much as I am a fan of Qt, the xfce and the Whisker menu setup was fun, and it far surpasses the lxqt version. Anyway, enjoy!   MichaelTheGamer"

3802,2021-04-30, Emmabuntüs, DE3-1.04,9,6,"A few months ago, I wrote a positive review for another distro here at DistroWatch.  Then I discovered Emmabuntus.  My ""distro hopping"" has come to an end!  I've tried many distros, and I had problematic issues with each one: I couldn't boot some distros on my hardware.  Some distros had major glitches with software (wouldn't launch, freeze up, wouldn't play audio, etc.)  Other distros ran slow as molasses on my old laptops.  What I love about Emmabuntus is that it manages to do something a lot of other distros haven't:  it's both ""beginner friendly"" AND it runs well on old hardware.  It runs reasonably fast on my 14 year-old Dell laptop.  It comes loaded with LOTS of software -- some people might find this a little overwhelming, or might want to ""build their own"" system, but for those who like to play around and see all the things a desktop Linux can do, this distro really fits the bill.  And, of course, it's based on the stable branch of Debian, so it's both reliable and has lots of packages available.Looking forward to Release 4!"

The hardwarespecifications for this laptop are:Toshiba Laptop Satellite 32 bit M30 series.CPU: Intel Pentium M 1.6 Ghz single Non-Pae processor.RAM: I upgraded the RAM from 512mb to 2gb in order to cope with the larger resource requirementsof today`s browsers/web-site contents and 2gb is the limit for RAM on this laptop.Hard Disc Drive: 80gb.Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce FX Go5200 64M.What does not work is Hybrid Sleep and Suspend so my solution is not to use these two functionsas Restart and Shutdown work normally. I use a wired (ethernet) connection for this laptop. A smallannoyance is always having to increase the display brightness at each boot-up as the change isnot carried over for each boot-up. My Canon printer works without any problem.The preconfiguration of programs is excellent for people who are Linux beginners and I now have amodern functioning computer and my sincere thanks to everyone in Emmabuntus.

Pentium M non-pae, 1 GB RAM.Installation is not automatic. But reading the Startup Guide new Linux users will handle the installation easily. RAM during installation ca. 350 MB. On our old laptop installation paused shortly a couple of times during the process, but no problems. Not necessary to forcepae.Initially there is a choice of several install languages. Mine was not listed, but I could select it during the installation and got the system and apps (except LibreOffice) installed in my locale.When rebooting the WiFi didn't work. Had to go to System Services and enable Network Manager (and PCMCIA).It boots into wrong choice of kernel (smp). So I have to click Advanced option and then avoid the smp alternatives.To avoid swap, we primarily use Abiword and Gnumeric and a light browser when working. (Firefox and LibreOffice simultaneously are OK, but is soon gobbling up the 1 GB RAM.)The Gslapt Package Manager is fast and userfriendly. The repository in Sourcery Slackbuild Manager is more comprehensive. Neither sort the programs in categories. I was not able to install Abiword from any of the repositories. Not belonging to the computer generation we got, however, instant help to install it successfully by the Terminal.I recommend Slackel primarily because it is booting fast, is stable and allow me to easily connect to all of my peripherals without using cmd. (I have used all versions since 7.2., and they have all behaved well.)"
3810,2021-01-24, Slackel, 7.4,7,10,"Slackel, as a Slackware derivate, is not bad. It has a graphical live with a graphical but complex installer, and it install a complete distribution with some tools like a package manager and a slackbuild gui. things like the kernel and the gnutils are updated and way newer than the Slackware ones and it has all you may need and more for regular and develop use, with wayland support preinstalled even on the openbox version (so you can install, idk, sway and use it without have to install the libraries).Slackel compared to other distros is not so much. Its packages list is extendend by slackbuild rather than the slackel package manager and if the gui tool doesn't work (like for me) is necessary tweak it to make it work or compile everything like it is Slackware with no dependencies gathering. Is a good way out for who uses Slackware but not a great idea for the ones who don't know the workflow and the tools or the one who want only a ""just work"" distro

I like most jumped about several distributions, I often used tails but have consigned it now to a USB in a drawer.I used Qubes, eventually...It was a real pain finding a machine to run it. I was not a fan of Fedora as a host, then using Debian as the default for everything else.I found Kicksecure and never looked back. Its my daily OS. I use Kicksecure as the host, sometimes live sometimes not and Whonix on Oracle Virtual Box, again sometimes live.Whonix elevates my security/safety to a level I could not achieve by myself, it protects me, even from me! "
3812,2022-11-02, Whonix, 16.0.4.2,10,7,The Whonix project is fantastic for both privacy and avoidance of censorship. Whonix empowers the people who use it. I hope to see this OS to continue to improve over time in its mission to protect those who require this level of security and privacy. Far better than just the standard TBB. Documentation is unmatched.I have used this OS everyday and it's never let me down. I appreciate the security by design. The distro protects users even from themselves. This is not a standard everyday OS but if you're in need of additional online privacy and security then Whonix is no contest. Tails is also good however if an adversary can root tails then its useless however the same for Whonix is not true. Personally id advise the use of KVM over Vbox but both were great!
3813,2022-08-22, Whonix, 16.0.4.2,9,14,"Honestly, it's incredible how easy it is to set this up and use immediately.The documentation is fantastic. I love the way the wiki is organised, one can learn a lot about how to properly use a system and how the many security measures work, how they keep the user safe from IP address leaks and other problems.A downside would be that it has relatively high system requirements since it is run in a virtual machine, but you can't eat your cake and have it too.All in all, an easy to use distribution for maintaining your privacy while browsing the internet, highly recommended."
3814,2022-08-16, Whonix, 14.0.1.4.4,10,57,"I love whonix, when I found out that I could use a plug and play tor desktop environment instead of just tor-browser. I was already down. Years later and it has gotten even better.As an ignorant person, I have failed to safely configure systems, many times and as a dumb person, I have falsely thought I was secure at times while sending out plain-text dns requests.I recommend whonix for anyone who cannot reliably configure a desktop. I understand and respect the Tails project but with whonix, I have a monitor-able gateway that everything runs through, this extra safeguard and isolation of data and tasks, provides me with a higher degree of safety.The dumbest thing I did when I first got whonix, was fail to realize it had a live mode for both gateway and workstation, it took me a good year to notice the live button, which made a lot of sense immediately and also made me feel kinda dumb.Also, this is entirely subjective, but a while back I lurked on the development forum or blog and found the culture to be (from the outside) a meritocracy and saw people contributing and moving through arguments without ego. Since I can't audit the code or understand many things, I use culture as a canary - I really think the people who work on this want to help people and I'm not being dramatic, I believe they have saved and/or protected many lives (bubble reminder, gay men in Africa can get death sentences still the stakes are high to be free all over the world.).Cheers to the devs of this project and the many, many, many, many incredible projects that this literally sits atop."

I want to offer my suggestion on dual-boot with Q4OS. I installed Q4OS KDE desktop on a 128GB USB SanDisk drive. I booted the Q4OS USB drive on a HP Intel Core I3, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD, WiFi, and Windows 11 in S mode OS laptop. After login, I ran ""sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y"". I rebooted and GRUB showed both OS in the boot menu. Of course, Q4OS was listed first and Windows 11 second. It booed both OSes from the GRUB menu. I removed the Q4OS USB key from the laptop, and Windows 11 booted as normal.It is true Q4OS wants to be exclusive! This solution avoids a separate partition on the SSD. Plus you can use the Q4OS USB Drive on any computer, just make sure you do the updates from the  computer listed in GRUB. This solution may not be for everyone, but it is an alternative for me.I loved the Q4OS KDE Plasma desktop.

It also runs very quickly on my 10 year old laptops. I am quite impressed with the improvements to KDE as well. Now I said it was a Prima Dona, and by that I mean this version doesn't play nicely with other boot scenarios. Oh, it will install alongside whatever OS you have, but then when you reboot the machine, the only option is Q4OS 5.2! Can I fix the boot manager? - Sure! But then, why should that be necessary for such an OS?  All the other popular distros play fairly - Linux Mint, Ubuntu, Debian,  Peppermint, and so on. Guess for now will have to regard this Q4os bug as a feature. So, If you are ready to use Q4os exclusively, or want to tinker with it to work with other distros, I say it is a great choice.

3827,2023-06-25, Q4OS, 4.12,9,2,"Great distro for old PCs and conservative users.I'm using it on my old PC, where were before Windows 7 and Vista, with TDE, which is using about 200MB RAM from 4GB in iddle. KDE Plasma is working well on this distro, too, no bugs and bloatware, so it's using about 500-600MB RAM with gadgets on desktop (I'm using only clocks, calendar and CPU/RAM usage bar).About installation:The Q4OS is using graphics installer, if you have live version or installation version with KDE Plasma, the Trinity installation version is using good old interface, which was used in older versions of Debian (some editions are using in nowadays) and in Ubuntu 4.10About Trinity:HW requirements are quite similar to Windows XP requirements, so 20 years PC will be running on this distro great. Interface is similar to this system, too, because it's based on KDE 3.5, which was released in 2005 and KDE is looking similar to Windows interface. But what has Q4OS comparing with other distros with TDE is XP menu style and installer setup, which is very similar to installer setup in Windows. It would be great, if this installer setup could be used for every .DEB package, not only for few apps, which are listed in special program.Only thing, which is missing in Q4OS, is GUI installer for packages, so you need to install it if you don't use terminal for packages installation. The second one is gamemode preinstalled, but it's small detail and this is not gaming distro.Result:It's great OS for every user, especially for users using old machines and conservative users, who are prefer truly PC interface than PC/tablet remix with big buttons, which is used by most newer DEs.Based on Debian is good choise for 32-bit support."
3828,2023-06-14, Q4OS, 5.0-testing,10,6,"Wow, I installed Q4OS with the Trinty desktop and I am stunned.  If you are looking to breathe new life into old hardware this is it.  I was looking for an alternative to the detestable antiX and came across Bodhi and Q4OS, both excellent choices for older hardware.At idle with wifi connectivity free -m indicated it came in at 293 MB (as a Live key) so knock off a few MB if you install it.While Bodhi has a more modern elegant looking desktop Q4OS seems positioned more like a throwback to the stable and practical days of Windows 95, Windows NT and Windows XP, and that is meant as a compliment.  For those of us who do not like the modern trend of forcing our PC and laptop desktops to mimic smartphones Q4OS is a comforting environment that was designed for days when the workstation was king, not some real estate restricted scrolling mess that modern desktops have become.But appearances aside Q4OS has some great utility features like its profiler, that is useful, functional, and customizable.    Q4OS also has some tricks up its sleeve to install on Windows that other distros should consider.All that aside it is fast.   I tested this on a IBM Thinkpad T61p from 2007 with 2 GB of RAM. Yep on a 16 year old machine and Q4OS was fast, no problem with YouTube running Chromium.   Q4OS also has utilities to tweak its themes etc that is easy to apply.So if you like the productivity of desktops of the past and blinding speed in a low resource environment in a stable environment try Q4OS.   If you like a more elegant look and feel try Bodhi.   Even lighter, checkout SliTaz, but Q4OS is slick,someone but a lot of effort into a distro that should be better known."

I have to give 9 out of ten because no distro is perfect, but this is great like MX or mint but faster and more responsive. I am in the process of putting Q4OS on all my older computers, while I have MX or Mint on the newer computers. Its intuitive KDE with almost the responsiveness of Artix, and it is a kick. The only very slight downside is I wish the repo were bigger, this distro is fun and right there with MX and Mint for quality."
3830,2023-05-17, Q4OS, 5.0-testing,9,7,"I stumbled upon this distro about a year and a half ago, just distro hopping. I migrated from KDE Neon, mainly because it updates like 5 times a day, was annoying. Q4OS simply works, is light on system resources, and I have yet to have a crash on it in the 1 1/2 years I have been using it. Detected all my hardware with no problems as well too. Am using a Lenovo laptop with a core I3 processor and 4 gigs of ram, and it runs super fast. This is the first review I have written on a distro, and that is saying something! It is definitely worth a try!"

3833,2023-03-06, Q4OS, 4.11,10,11,"Q4OS  is a rather interesting Debian derivative which puts little strain on hardware and can function equally well at an introductory level for most newbies or for more complicated use for experienced Linux users and can work with both ARM and X86 form factor processors.   I have used it on big desktops and on an old laptop long ago with no major issues.   Its Trinity desktop is a bit tired looking, but it does work and in a KDE Plasma form it has a crisper look at the expense of a bit more processor power, but still works nicely.I will give a somewhat lengthy example of the distribution's utility here:I recently got a very good buy on an Alldocube Tablet PC which I did not expect to use with Windows and I rapidly ran into problems trying to load it with Linux software of unexpected forms.   The tablet has a nice look and size and can support itself with its own built in support which is not dependent on the detachable keyboard using the Pogo interface.   I was hoping to make this into a workable Linux tablet and tried some smaller form distributions or distribution-like settings.   Puppy could function byt was awkward and not terribly efficient on the unit if loaded.   Touchscreen function was inconsistent.  In the near-distribution form, AntiX was unable to establish a wireless connection and had no audio and could not really move beyond an Ethernet connection.    Fedora was tried in a stripped-down version with audio only with headphones and at low volume and had problems with not being able to be updated despite easy wireless setup that made the AntiX setup look pathetic.Manjaro XFCE was tried next and gave horrid flickering of the Intel UHDgraphics630 card which was negotiated poorly in AntiX and well in Fedora.  While flickering, I could guess a location and the touchscreen would mostly respond where the screen was blacked out rather bizarrely.  I managed to push the work on this with no resolution and no good sound and poor wireless function thought better than with AntiX.Bunsen would not load well either with flickering of the screen and no sound and the camera was a no go as well.After this comes Q4OS as I am not a big Ubuntu fan and did not want to play with Lite or with Lubuntu with its formidable content. Q4OS was not really known much for use in tablets that I could see, but it was reliable Debian and Debian has played better with Intel UHD graphics600 series so I gave it a try.   Q4OS loaded easily and fairly quickly, picked up the graphics as well as the wireless and even had the camera function picked up.  Touchscreen was no problem either.   The installation was the least problematic, though audio remains an issue.  No function can be found of the Realtek/Intel series which is recognized but not easily teased forward despite the use of Alsamixer and Pipewire.   I have not tried to back up to OSS or other audio drivers.   Use of DKMS has not made any difference either.   I hope that firmware update or Kernel incorporated updates can bring the audio functionality to some end, but I can always add on a USB audio card system.   Perhaps I can use a small headset unit such as Plugable for headphone port action using the snd-usb-audio driver which I have used before or the similar UGreen interface.  Both have worked reliably for others I have known with Linux or even with less sophisticated Raspberry Pi computers.With Q4OS, the poor support of this PC tablet has been relatively easy to manage.  I find Q4OS has reasonable function from its KDE Plasma base and the substantial 8 GB RAM of the PC Tablet should be able to work fairly nicely as a tablet with good power, even with the large KDE footprint.    Q4OS has been by far the easiest distribution for this purpose. "
3834,2023-03-05, Q4OS, 4.11,10,6,"Perfect for an old laptop, even touchpad gestures run out of the box, a feature never before seen and I have tried more than 20 distros.Trinity desktop looks very tidy, might be my 2nd favourite after XFCE.Integration of Konqueror with many other apps is interesting, but I'm leaning to not using it too much.Only downside is that bootloader install is more confusing than usual.I probably wouldn't install this OS on modern machine, but on old hardware I haven't seen better and trust me, I have tried many distros."
3835,2023-02-22, Q4OS, 4.11,9,3,"It was recommended to me by a forum member. At first, though, I picked the 64-bit edition with KDE. It starts blinding fast. I don't know what the developers did to the D.E. but this is a pleasant surprise. It looks a bit plaid compared to the later Plasmas but I don't care, I dislike animations and desire quick fast over shenanigans. No problems installing Wine and using other programs. I wish I could write more about it but it's boring in a good way. One hitch is that it shuts down somewhat slowly; soon after I click ""OK"" on shutdown confirmation it holds for several seconds. On this installation I skipped the Desktop Profiler, couldn't be arsed with it to give me junk like Libreoffice and VLC while there are much-better programs.Later I decided to take up on that forum member's offer, grabbing the ISO for the 32-bit operating system with Trinity. (It has to be installed and uses a version of Debian installer.) It doesn't ask for network options but that is handled in the first time the user boots successfully into the system. This OS supports Wifi which is a big plus. Nice desktop; my first try with it was supposed to be RebornOS 64-bit but I had installation problems with that. A reason why I didn't want to keep it was because it seems to use Konqueror as file manager, but I'm not used to it. It behaves a lot like Windows98, the desktop menu also. On Trinity desktop I couldn't find the way to disable touchpad tap-to-click (doesn't seem to carry ""synclient"" program) and it was clunky having to visit the terminal to run ""xrandr"" only to lower the screen brightness from full burst. I don't recommend going to ""System Administration/Monitor Settings"" because it asks for the user password before setting anything in there, and if you do it wrong in the ""gamma"" screen it could totally screw up the view! Therefore I accepted the Desktop Profiler option to move up to KDE Plasma v5.20. However it could take at least an hour and copies over 120 thousand files into your disk!Running ""update-initramfs"" takes a really long time and the ""distro update"" could do it three times or more. Just don't fiddle with ""swap"" partition, you have been warned, it's not like with Arch Linux where if the UUID of ""swap"" is changed it only requires editing ""/etc/fstab"". I wish Debian's developers did something about it.For the 32-bit installation, if Q4OS isn't going to be the only OS put on the internal HDD do not pick ""guided entire disk"" partitioning from the installer because it creates only two partitions, the main one and ""swap"" which might be too small, and it would require assistance from GRUB for another distro to be able to boot into it. For me the install failed at bootloader stage; at this point the user should select ""Continue without bootloader"" from Debian installer main menu. Someone else would have deducted points for it.by mnrv-ovrf-year-c"

Everything works as promised. I have Q4OS (with the Cinnamon desktop environment installed afterwards) running in its own 48 GB virtual partition (let’s call it that: a virtual partition) but have full access to the Windows section of the SSD drive.

3838,2023-01-10, Q4OS, 4.11,1,3,Disappointing and frustrating experience especially after reading many good reviews. I was unable to install the live ISO on bare metal. Tried downloading the ISO (from several of their download links) and flashing it to two different flash drive I verified are not faulty. Used Balena Etcher to flash ISO to thumb drive. Each time the OS tried to load it got stuck on the black screen with the boot text. It would start to load and then just hang. Concluded something is wrong with the ISO that is posted.

Better that Linux Mint (that I love and was using before) because of the effort to make it look like Windows, by using great KDE themes. Prefered the full install to get Office suite, etc. Just select the win10 in parameters and boom, system looks like Windows (Though it works differently, like single click open a file).I disagree with people below that find it slow. It is NOT, and is working perfectly fine out of the box. Discover is the very simple app market and using deb package is simple also.This is now my primary OS. Win11 is on a second partition for 1 proprietary program I cannot yet use in Linux (I need to learn alternative).I use dual boot. Files are on a shared partition (in NTFS ane encrypted by Bitlocker). This encrypted partition is seamlessly accessible via Q4OS (just enter the bitlocker partition password at Q4OS start).It is not perfect, I had to install Segoe UI font to improve the win10/11 look. Some glitches happen sometimes. That' OK. I will not come back to windows as my first OS. And I have saved some money by refurbishing some old computers with Q4OS, like my Acer C720P tactile chromebook...Everything works fine.

3842,2022-11-06, Q4OS, 4.10,8,1,Slow loading on startup. Slow installing applications. Slow uninstalling applications. Toooooo many updates.Won't run Opera. Discover is very limited. Other than those things it is a great little alternative to windows 10 or 11 hell. biden would probably use it if he could remember how to run it. Highly suggest using it. It will grow on you.

3843,2022-10-20, Q4OS, 4.10,8,8,"Version 64 bits with Trinity desktop.Once installed, everything works fine on my very low power pc (Atom 2 GB Ram): the system is a Debian.Since now I did not encountered some old problems that where present on the previous version (for example, a crash from time to time of Dolphin).My hardware works fine,  no problem with the printer, the scanner, sound and webcam. Even Skype works fine.I did not tried all the software packages, but all those ones I tried worked fine.This version is a good choice for everyone that wants a working system on old hardware or just someone, like me, that loves old fashioned but working desktop (by the way Trinity is the last available version)..So why just 8 and not 10 on my rating?1. the basic theme  gives a start menu that could be, in my opinion, confusing: why not put it simpler? (ok, there are other theme you ca choose from, where the start menu is simpler)2. the strong emphasis on Konqueror: I really like it, but as a browser now it is not the best one, so maybe the best choiice is to use a real modern browser and a separate file manager.3. the installation, on my machine, was really hard: I tried many times. My hard disk config is an old classic: 3 main partitions and one logic with many partitions. It was impossible to install it on a logic partition (boot on that partition or on MBR), at last I was able to install it on one main partition and boot on that."
3844,2022-10-17, Q4OS, 4.10,4,18,"Q40S team raises the bar of expectations about their Trinity distro on their website: ""lightweight, fast, efficient, in many ways surpasses competition.. we love it so much..."" I downloaded and installed q4os-4.10-x64-tde.r2.iso. I tested it thoroughly for almost a week by using it as my ""main daily driver"". Neither Q4OS nor Trinity surpass any competition to put it mildly.Live session starts promising with clear messages and friendly pop-ups. Feel n looks are utterly windowzy. Dejavu. WinXP reborn. Home-brew installers of popular apps amusingly imitate the classic install-shield setups.  But my amusement stopped there.Q40S cannot install a working Grub in UEFI either by following the defaults or by partitioning manually the disk and creating a 300mb fat32 partition mounted at /boot/efi and flagged as ""boot"". I booted a random Debian live iso. Mounted local partitions and reinstalled grub from the command line. Not exactly the windowzy way to install a ""Desktop Operating System"".Trinity is indeed colourful and highly customizable in pure KDE vein. Alas it remains buggy like its KDE progenitor. ""Theme Manager"" erases 30 minutes of customization by just pressing OK. It reverts to defaults while THERE IS a ""defaults"" button on the left. Control panel offers duplicate and overlapping options with sometimes baffling lack of... control. You have not permission to change this or that setting as plain user, you are not offered with credential prompts upon saving and not an easy way to run the control panel as admin.Keybindings are a sore point. They are somehow hardcoded. You cannot switch keyboard layouts but with ""alt+ctrl+K"" only. ""TDE Keyboard Tool"" residing on the system tray offers the option to change the keyboard shortcut but it does not actually work. People use alt+shift, super+space, ctrl+shift etc not only on Linux but on every ""Desktop Operating System"". Now try to bind terminal to standard ctrl+alt+T. It is ctrl+T on Q40S Tde but cannot be applied when some app windows are active when it conflicts with the app keybindings. You have to deselect active windows and click on an empty space of the desktop.Mime types handling is even worse. For some strange reason ""popular"" file types like epub are not recognized as such, even when you force association with a relevant program. Mime type is not application/x-epub+zip as the default /etc/default/mime.types designates in good ol' debian way! It is application/x-kdeuser1 (!) because Trinity interferes with mime-type handling creating some .local/share/mime folder with obscure configuration files.I found my way around but I'll you tell this: it wasn't worth my time. Some things should work out of the box. They do… in competition.Handing of some menial tasks is frustrating. You attach an external usb drive to your comp. A media applet in the tray prompts you with the option to mount it and Konqueror opens it. So far so good. Try now to play media files stored in your external drive, videos or music files. ""Couldn't create GStreamer source element for media:/sdb1/Music/[nameofyourmusicalbum]/02. [nameofthetrack].flac"". Media applet mounts the external drive onto ""media:/sdbX"", a path that is not recognized by the very same media players ""Q4Os Software Center"" installs. If you go around through your file manager you'll find the same drive in ""media/yourusername/labelofyourdrive"" where any other distro would have pointed you to straight away. You wonder what would happen if Q40S developers didn't really love Trinity so much. Bottom line: As Windows-meme Q4OS Trinity version has its moments. For anything else, such as running a lean and capable desktop on an old PC, use xfce or icebox or anything, my friends, if you want a customizable and at the same time transparent and reliable system, but not Trinity as at least distributed by Q4OS."

Installation was easy for me, a Windows nerd. So far, Q4OS has worked great, and I plan to continue to use it to meet my Linux needs.Here are minor issues that kept me from giving Q4OS 4.10 a rating of 10:1. An icon appeared in the dock to inform me that updates were available. When I tried to install the updates, the update process failed. Google helped me to learn that I needed to run ""sudo apt update"" and ""sudo apt dist-upgrade"" before the automated updates would succeed. I think that the automatic updates application should be smart enough to just work without me needing to prepare the computer for updates from the command line.2. Q4OS comes with two web browsers, Firefox and Konqueror. Firefox is up to date and works well, but Konqueror is out of date and should not be used to browse the web. Konqueror also serves as the file manager, which is fine, but Konqueror is prominently presented as a web browser with Konqueror ""Web Browser"" shortcuts placed on the desktop and the taskbar by default.

There were a couple of odd interface irritations, but nothing more.  everything worked and worked well  and performance was excellent. Performance is largely the result of good hardware and a decent core OS, but the desktop experience is mostly due to the WM or desktop environment.  I found Trinity natural and dependable. Note: Many of the packages were stable editions, nothing is really ""cutting edge"", but neither is it stale. "
3853,2022-08-01, Q4OS, 4.10,10,5,"I have found that Q4OS is an excellent fast, reliable, and stable OS to run on a roomful of older (20+ year old) computers in a vocational resource room.  It has broad compatibility, ease of use (looks a lot like windows) and is easy to update and add programs to.  The only downside is its somewhat plain appearance but I like it that way. Of the dozens of lite Linux OSes I have tried over 5+ years Q4OS has been the best by far!  Each version up the the current one has been excellent!  I wish there could be more current reviews about Q4OS so more people would know about it.  "

It has its own tools that facilitate the installation of programs, private codecs, etc. It makes life easier on the Debian planet. It allows a computer to be ready in 10-15 minutes, something that is impossible in a Debian. It comes with kde plasma but also kde trinity which is lighter and has a ""retro"" feel to it.It automatically detected my Nvidia card and installed the drivers when asked, something that does not happen in mx linux, nor in sparky, nor in debian distros (i mean, the right drivers)."

I had great performance on a Celeron+4GB RAM. Painless setup with its own GUI tools for codecs, software and various settings and easy installation thanks to Calamares. I found this distro looking for a PC revival OS, but I'll probably end up installing it on modern hardware just because of how good it is, taking a mostly unaltered Debian base and preparing it for desktop use."
3859,2022-07-13, Q4OS, 4.8,10,1,"Excellent distro with a great set of its own tools. Desktop profiler really simplifies using and customizing new installations. Comfortable for former Windows users and newcomers to Linux too. Trinity desktop runs very fast and it's snappier then any other desktop I have used. But Plasma desktop is definitely more modern and reliable then the Trinity desktop, so I prefer Plasma. I had a glitch with Wifi USB dongle, but I understand hardware support follows the Debian base. Another great and unique option is the Windows installer, it even works on the Windows 11 with secure boot BIOS. Overall distribution rating 10/10."

I'm running the 32 bit version on a 2008 Intel Atom N270 netbook with 2GB of RAM and a slow mechanical hard drive. It is probably one of the few viable operating systems on such a low performance computer.The Trinity Desktop Environment is a gem. It is really very polished. Qt based (KDE derived, not sure), resembling Windows XP while maintaining a very consistent look throughout the system. Trinity is that good and should be more seriously considered in other distributions.The system also comes with an excellent text based installer that does manual partitioning very well. Installation is minimal, and uponfirst graphical boot you are greeted with a start windows that allows you to choose the main packages / codecs and everything you need to configure your system in a very user friendly way.Hardware support was excellent, with WiFi, Wireless Printing, Bluetooth, TrackPad, Vertical Scrolling, and keyboard shortcuts (volume, brightness etc) working straight out of on first boot (only bluetooth requires a base package installation, which is offered on the welcome screen).I'm delighted.

This distro is very well thought out and the new version is so polished and professional, and yet it will run great on an older machine. What more could you need, a very intuitive gem with speed and a rock solid vast software selection of Debian. There is no weakness here, this is built to survive and get work done. This is distro is not built for beauty, but it does have a charm all of its own, and makes me think of the days of XP when you just got work done.A truly special distro.                                                               Thanks devs"

I had Kubuntu installed prior to this and Manjaro prior to that (I've basically used just about every distro in existence at one time of another). Q4OS doesn't offer the breadth of programs an Arch-based distro does, but then again it also doesn't suffer the self-imposed suicide rolling releases succumb to inevitably. Q4OS is significantly better than Kubuntu. It is faster, installs easier, and other software packages install without a hitch that Kubuntu chokes on. "

It was very lightweight, stable but only moderately fluid (e.g. compared to AntiX).To give numbers, the RAM usage oscillated between 200 and 350 mb (idle).Also, it tends to reminds too much Windows XP by a visual point of view. In my opinion, a bit of originality would have been better also because using Konqueror as default windows manager is not great for the pleasure of the eyes in 2022. Thus, I rate it 7.Q4OS Plasma is a simple and solid Debian-distro.RAM usage in idle was always around 900 mb.What I missed is a more refined app center and a more attractive global look.

3867,2022-03-08, Q4OS, 4.7,10,2,"I used Manjaro's GNOME, Cinnamon, and Plasma. Manjaro is awesome. However, I have been leaning to going to a more long term stable release and undecided. I used Q4OS before on an older 32-bit machine and liked it but it did not influence me. It was good and I left it on there knowing it would always work. Since I was looking into a stable release for my main 64-bit PC, I was reading more about Q4OS and comparing it to Debian proper considering Debian, Linux Mint or MX Linux. I liked the ease of installation provided by Q4OS. What really sold me on this distribution is the Windows Installer. I was able to download a small file to Windows directly and execute the installation of Q4OS from within Windows 10 without doing partitioning. Bottom line, flawless installation and I keep my default Windows 10 boot loader for my wife but can switch to the Q40S boot loader when I am on the PC. The PC will still boot automatically into Windows 10 without messing around with GRUB. Fantastic way to incorporate Linux. I was using KDE Plasma and liking it - one of my favorite desktops on any distribution. I was able to also install the Cinnamon desktop and its awesome! The installation was done via the Q4OS profiler which downloads other desktop environments for you. Cinnamon is fast, sleek, and good looking. I have a stable distribution with 3 desktops bootable from my main drive without messing my Windows boot loader - just awesome. I still like my Manjaro on a separate SSD but Q4OS and Debian are fantastic. It's not the newest software but I am learning that new software is not the end-all-be-all. I feel more confident now using Debian as a daily-driver. Although in all fairness to Manjaro, I have been using it as a daily-driver from a separate SSD and it has been flawless. But I am liking that I am not getting constant package updates with Q4OS and if I don't use this machine for a week or two, there won't be any issues because any updates will be small versus the Arch updates which can be large. Kudos to the Q4OS developers! If you want a fast, nimble, and stable distribution that is flexible built on the solid and boring foundation of Debian - this is a great distribution. BTW - ""boring"" is good - it means you will finish what you were doing on your PC and shutdown without any surprises or necessary fixes the next time you boot up. For me, I like that it gives me an easy way to get Debian from within Windows 10 without messing up my Windows installation. I am very happy with this solid distribution."
3868,2022-03-02, Q4OS, 4.7,10,14,"Q4OS is everything a good Debian spin should be: stable, reasonably updated packages, fast and good on resources, with the codecs and some good themes, etc. that you don't get from a Debian installation. You can choose either legacy KDE Trinity or Plasma. I chose Plasma, and for me it beats any other Debian spin I have used, whether MX, Neptune, Devuan, siduction, etc. One of the issues I have with MX is too many MX tools and too much conky focus; not that you can't just ignore these and/or turn them off, but still... so...much...bloat. Just give me a basic, minimal setup and let me choose the rest. Q4OS excels at this.Having a variety of choices for installation is a plus: full desktop, basic, minimal. Choose your starting point and go from there. A very pleasant, bloat-free experience. Downloaded everything else I needed quickly and easily, albeit I prefer just using the terminal and apt rather than GUI tools such as Discover, Synaptic, or the Q4OS Software Center, but the choice is yours to make.The included WinXP, Win10, and Q4OS Debonaire themes are nice. I was never a Windows user, so I don't really care to replicate that experience, but the Debonaire theme is very nice.To me, Q4OS is the perfect balance of Debian simplicity and stability, and desktop functionality."
3869,2022-02-17, Q4OS, 4.7,9,4,"Very good. All works perfectly so far. I had no issues with NVIDIA drivers as opposite to MX Linux and Mint installation. If you want KDE + Debian in a light distro, this is the one for you. The only negative point I have found so far is the windows-style package manager. Fortunatelly you can easily switch to Synaptics which is much better."
3870,2022-02-01, Q4OS, 4.7,10,8,"I am using the KDE environment. Excellent, clean, fast and stable distribution. After downloading, it consumes only 0.41 GB of RAM. Before that I tried Manjaro, Kubuntu, Neon but Q4 the best. I'm using the Base version. There is no software in it at all, but it can be installed by choice in 2-3 minutes from a special Q4 program without using a terminal.Unlike Manjaro and Ububtu-based distributions, which are constantly downloading updates, Q4 is based on the stable debian 5.10 kernel. The distribution kit just works and does not bother with notifications and patches.The only problem that arose was telegram, which was outdated in the Debian repository and did not connect, but I connected Flatpack and downloaded the latest version

3871,2023-07-21, LXLE, 18.04.3,9,1,"
I installed LXLE on a very old EMachines Mini. It has a nice streamlined installer but I did encounter some bugs installing the OS, including a few crashes. To be fair, that could be down to the laptop which is 13+ years old. Once installed it worked wonderfully. I like its simple, clean, window manager and lightweight, no nonsense approach. I did have issues running upgrade from the command line on first try. Interestingly, it actually offered the command to fix the issue, I've never seen that before in Linux. Mind you, I've never had that problem before either. Still, well done.The key strength is this OS runs seamlessly and well, on very old hardware. I could install upgrades from the command line, all the while browsing on line, without interruption. Wow.I like this OS so much I'm contemplating putting it on other laptops. It would work like a rocket on newer hardware. Great effort."

Of course the repositories fail and software updates are not available. But I can do what I want with it and love the interface. As it is an old version, listing the cons might be irrelevant, such as playing a stuttering HD video MP4 in VLC or struggling for a large pdf to load but that is to be expected. It does the job and I can always run FLDIGI, minesweeper and solitaire if I get bored. I'm only an amateur Linux user but I like LXLE for running on something which would otherwise be in the skip. "
3874,2023-03-22, LXLE, Focal,10,6,I rate a 10 because I had no problems installing and configuring the distro.  Nice looking in every way.  Software reinstalled is exactly what I wanted; no bloat. I have tried many distros - I am a hopped. I think I will stand on Lxle or a while.  I know that the software is not the very latest as on Manjaro but to be hones I can not tell the difference.  Most software update are very incremental anyway.  I would recommend Lxle to a beginner in Linux but a more advanced user would be satisfied.  Need to try it.
3875,2023-02-20, LXLE, Focal,9,2,"My favorite distro for old 32-bit machines. I also like it for new hardware. Subjective, yes, but I just like the speed, clarity and simple elegance of his distro and desktop. I am not a gamer so I don't know how it would do in that regard. I keep trying to distro hop away from it but it just keeps me coming back.My reason for giving it a 9 instead of a 10 is its software store while quite broad in scope, is quite outdated. But then again, I rarely use the software stores on any of the distros."
3876,2022-12-08, LXLE, Focal,9,5,"Runs excellent on an old Intel Centrino Windows Vista Thinkpad. I tried other distros, mostly ubuntu-based but also manjaro xfce, and LXLE is by far the best. It's tuned really well to ThinkPads, I haven't run it on any other machines, but I'd start with LXLE for any old machine that I wanted to resurrect. Super stable, straightforward. Not flashy or a ton of customization, but there's enough. It's real value is performance with limited resources, combined with ease of use, put this distro right at the top imo for executing a clear vision beautifully. Nicely done and thanks."

3880,2022-07-28, LXLE, Focal,10,3,"I am very relieved to see the very worthwhile LXLE project is still very much alive with the new 'Focus' version.  Relieved, as LXLE is one of only a few easy-to-use distros that will run well on old/low-powered software (in my case a 14-year-old laptop Asus X71Q). There seemed to be some uncertainty for a while, regarding LXLE's continuation - hence the relief!One great improvement over the previous 18.04 version is that it will plug-and-play with an external monitor, i.e. our Samsung TV. With version 18.04, I had to add three additional lines of code to 'Autostart' under 'LXSession', to enable this plug-and-play. However, with the Focal version, it worked from the get-go, without any additions to LXSession. Many thanks for this!Good to see other changes too. LibreOffice - nice to have this more comprehensive office suite preinstalled for the first time, over the previous lightweight (though somewhat limited) 'abiword' & 'gnumeric'.  The extremely lightweight browser LibreWolf is a first and nice to have - the first time I've used this, and good that it comes with an adblocker (uBlock Origin) preinstalled. The rest is much the same as before: all the essential stuff, but kept to a lightweight minimum.

It does everything a lightweight distro says it does: runs fast and low on system resources, and provides a familiar Windows look.

And I left it with regret of how beautiful it was until the previous release.On the other hand, LXLE remained with LXDE, obtaining a very respectable result.I must confess that before trying it I was very skeptical, in fact after 18.4 all the derivatives of Ubuntu are becoming very heavy. Furthermore, the trend is that they will become more and more.For those like me, still noob (since 2003) and very lazy, this distro is a great choice. In fact you get all the support and ease of use of Ubuntu, with a distro that is very light and responds very well.My opinion is that LXLE may be very good for pc built after 2010, for those of the previous years now antiX has no more competitors and is unbeatable"

Even windows 10 IOT enterprise doesn't come close in wisely allocating system resources.  With this distro, it is possible to even rescue Intel P4 processors from being thrown away as unusable e-waste.

This is a review of the Gnome version. There is also an Xfce version available.After being disappointed with the last few versions of Linux Mint and the state of the Cinnamon desktop, I decided to switch to Gnome as my DE. I've never been much of a fan of Gnome, but after the bugginess of KDE and the last few versions of Cinnamon, as well as the general jankiness of other desktops, I've decided to settle on Gnome. In addition, I require a Debian base because I have a slow internet connection, so I would prefer less updates. Of course, I couldn't use Ubuntu either because Snaps update automatically (which is not only inconvenient for me, but also disgusting from the perspective of user freedom).I tried using plain Debian, but it turned out to be too much work for me. I wanted something user-friendly, like Linux Mint or Ubuntu. There seem to be very few Debian-based distros with Gnome, and most of them are not very user-friendly. After a long search, I finally found Pardus.Pardus is an excellent distro. Probably the best one out there. Everything just works out of the box, both the DE and the Debian base. It has plenty of tools, such as Power Manager, Image Writer, Java Installer and USB Formatter. It also has a Welcome screen that helps you set up a wallpaper, theme, scaling and introduces keyboard shortcuts to you. The Gnome desktop is modified here to closer resemble Ubuntu, which is great for someone like me who doesn't particularly like the vanilla workflow of Gnome. They even have a Computer icon on the desktop, which is a custom application with links to drives and folders that resembles the Windows' Computer folder.The developers paid so much attention to detail that even the text under desktop icons has proper shadows, which is something most distros do not have, and it always drives me crazy. Windows has had shadows since 98 days, but most DEs and the distros that ship with them either don't have them at all or have very weak ones. KDE is the only desktop that has those shadows by default and strong enough, so KDE distros usually don't have that problem, but all the other ones continue to have it. So this was such a pleasant surprise to see that the Pardus devs paid attention to this aspect.The pre-installed applications are the sanest defaults. Mostly just the regular Gnome suite of applications; no Thai terminals, Dictionaries or other weird stuff that vanilla Debian ships with. The Pardus Software Center is probably the best I've seen. Incredible amount of available applications. I've installed all of my usual applications, and the only one I had to go into the browser for was Waterfox. It unfortunately does not have Flatpak pre-installed, but you can install a Flatpak store (forked from Elementary store) right from the Pardus Software Center. I did it and installed a Whatsapp from it, and it worked perfectly. In restrospect, I could also install Waterfox from there if I knew about it at the time. So, with the Flatpak store combined, you get pretty much anything you'd ever want right from the Software Center.I can't praise this distro enough. This is truly an Ubuntu-killer in my book. If you like Ubuntu but hate Snaps, this distro is for you. It seems on their website, they also have a Server version, an Edu version and an ETAP (which I think is electricity management software) version. This seems like a pretty serious distro that has plans to stay, and the devs seem to put in an incredible amount of work into it. I highly recommend it, and hope it becomes more popular, as I think it deserves to be spoken about in the same conversations as Mint and Ubuntu, as I think it's better than either of them as a general-use beginner-friendly distro."
3902,2023-05-09, Pardus, 21.5,10,13,"I was looking for a distribution based on Debian but easier to use and a more ""out of the box"" experience. I was completely satisfied with Pardus. It's super easy to install, looks pretty nice and consistent. It has an excellent choice of software installed by default and a set of very useful tools. The software center is one of the best I've used and with the most common software available just a click away. All hardware works smoothly. I think Pardus is a top distribution, stable and very well done. One of the things that pleased me the most was seeing that despite Pardus being a distribution more targeted towards Turkish users, I noticed that the Portuguese language is also present throughout the system, including the tools developed by Pardus, being from Portugal, I found this a added value! congratulations to the Pardus team. For anyone in need of a debian-based distribution more easy to use, Pardus is probably one of the best distributions available."
3903,2023-01-18, Pardus, 21.4,9,9,"Took it for a test drive and really was impressed with it. It's suitable for beginners and experienced users.I tested it on an low spec laptop and it ran like a charm.True, it's based on Debian stable and has rather older software. But it's stable and reliable as Debian goes, but also a pleasure to use en work with it. It runs fast and looks nice. It has his own, well balanced software center, and of course you can always use synaptic. So, no hassle to install what you need. It has a decent set of systems tools, without being bloated. Only minus point for me: firewall gufw is not installed by default. I hope the developers fix this in the next release.In my opinion this is the best Debian bases distro I used, and it's good looking too. The developers really did a good job. It's a shame Pardus is not in the top ten of the rankings and that reviewers don't give it much attention.Want a user friendly Debian base? Look no further."
3904,2022-11-26, Pardus, 21.3,8,9,"I have been using this distro for a week as my main machine now. I hopped to Pardus from Arch Linux since unstable packages caused me a lot of headache. This was not the first time I tried using Pardus but it was the longest. On GUI side, this distro is incredibly smooth to use. There is a nice software center and simple yet nice looking icons out of the box. Installation process was also great. It asked me things that I certainly require or nice to have. Everything complicated was hidden from me and I liked this approach.Software center is great. There are no long cache retrieval durations, no buggy process bars, no random crashes, etc. I'm not sure if this is because the Pardus servers are near me but I can say that they work great, at least for me. There are many proprietary software included in the repos. Although one might argue that this shouldn't be the case but end-user loves such things. After installing pardus, I had a zoom meeting an hour later and I totally forgot installing the app. I confidently opened the software center and typed ""zoom"". The app was there, ready for me to install. I checked out the store for a while and noticed things like:-Chrome, Opera, Brave, Edge, Spotify, Steam, Telegram, Discord, Skype, Slack, TeamViewer, some IDEs for developers...I personally think these are great to have since most people would use at least one or two of these anyway. However, there are some major problems with other parts of the repo.The repo is old. It's understandable for Debian to be old since Its main focus is on server stability. For end-users, however, this old repo is problematic. I found myself using third party package managers just to keep some packages up to date. Kernel is also in version 5.10. I think this should change in next releases. I don't expect it to be Arch level but I would appreciate newer packages. "

3922,2023-03-25, Parrot, 5.2,10,11,"    People who use this don't care about wallpapers. But here they are beautiful. Although that is irrelevant. The beauty of Linux is its functionality. Because it's rare. Mate DE is strange and often prone to bugs. Not here. The Parrot OS development team has done an amazing job. Here's why I use this distro:    The first laptop I installed Linux on was a Fujitsu Siemens Amilo about fifteen years ago. Over time, I changed machines and therefore different distributions. Now after many years (I'm sorry I didn't realize it earlier) I can say one important thing about Linux distributions - each one has its own brand on which it works flawlessly. So I had Solus on a Fujitsu Lifebook U727 - it didn't work at all. I used Solus because I was used to it when I had a Thinkpad T450 and Thinkpad T420 before that. Now that Solus is a half-dead distro, I tried Windows 11. It runs Windows, but on this laptop, not the way I'd like. Plus I have another machine (Asus Vivobook X507UF) for Windows because it has Nvidia dedicated graphics and therefore I didn't want to throw Linux on it.     The bottom line is that Linux introduced me to a world that is hard to describe in words. The world of Cyber Security. A world where hacking is a game. I never had money for expensive new computers, I always worked with what I had and that was often not enough. For example, I now have two laptops that I bought for 450 euros.  With the right software for each of them, there are no limits. Software development or whatever comes to mind is now at my fingertips.     Considering that Parrot OS is a Debian based distro, it works perfectly on a 12"" Fujitsu Lifebook U727 with 8GB RAM and i5-6300U CPU. Since I have two laptops now I can hack myself and learn some interesting skills in the process. I do all this as a hobby. I'm not officially educated and I'm not young enough to expect a career out of all this. I just hope to acquire certain skills so that I can acquire new ones faster.

I like this because it already exists and is configured with anonsurf, but this Parrot has problems with the UI on the top bar, and the wifi network is sometimes disconnected, what's worse is that the consumption of battery resources is very wasteful, different from the windows I have, NVIDIA drivers are not readable, bash terminal so weird. When playing Hack the Box crafting the payload can't the result is different, but when I crafted with Kali linux it worked somehow what went wrong, I used the same command, I suggest if you use this OS to play CTF better the Hack the Box or Kali version"

I thought I found that distro with Parrot OS. I had it setup just like I wanted it. I moved all of my files over to it and then the problems began. I noticed it drained my laptop battery like crazy. It appeared to be using Nvidia drivers when I wanted it to just use Intel (I have an Optimus based laptop). Normally, this is not a problem on other distos. No matter what I tried, it appeared to always use the Nvidia drivers, even after I removed all trace of Nvidia from the system and the battery continued to drain. Next, a system update took out the Bluetooth. No matter what I tried, I could not get Bluetooth to work. I decided to go to their official forum and it was down for weeks! Their website constantly goes down along with their repositories. For some reason, updates will not install randomly as well.Parrot OS seems half baked to me. The fact they can't keep their website or repositories up is a very bad sign. When the forums came back up I found out Bluetooth stopped working for everyone and there was no fix in sight. People loudly complained about the forum being down for weeks. This is amateur hour. I'm pretty sure this OS is not secure at all either.Don't waste your time."

Also good for computer programmers (easy and fast to create a new document - python, C/C++, HTML... with a pre-built structure, very useful). Of course one of my favourite Linux distros. Other functionalities are similar to the most famous Kali Linux, but this one is heavier, it also requires a lot of resources and, IMHO, ParrotOS graphic is more beautiful."

I also tested other distros for different purposes, like light, fast and small footprint for older computers and I found 3 that are my favorites in this category, but as far as having a daily, production OS, I settled with Parrot.I'm not too geeky or too expert to be able to do some serious work from the command line, but I can follow instructions from others when the necessity arises. For example I had to do some minor system changes in Kali and I crashed it twice. I reinstalled it 3 times and the next time I had a similar problem I had to solve, instead of spending time in the forums trying to learn something new, I decided to try other OS. That's when I decided to try Parrot.So far Parrot OS has not disappointed me."

It offers a ton of cyber security and hacking software right off the bat. It would be my favorite distro if they maintained a LTS variant.The reason why I only gave it a 7 is due to my personal experience with it's rolling updates. I've encountered too many corrupt GUI bugs with each update that becomes too much of a hassle to fix each time. This is most common on my Asus AMD APU laptop and my AMD FX - Geforce 980 GTX desktop.

This is a very neat little operating system, I'm running it on my Redmi 2 and it's working perfectly. I recommend this to anyone who wants to learn something new about the way their phone works and how Linux is implemented on it. The installation procedure is surprisingly easier to understand than some desktop Linux distributions, and every interface feels polished and thought out. The package manager is very fast, although some applications are missing on the aarch64 architecture of the Alpine Linux repository compared to the x86-64 architecture

Ubuntu was the first distribution I used on Linux. Then I was a distrohopper for 4 years and learned everything about Debian/Ubuntu, Arch, Gentoo, Opensuse and other alternatives like Void, Slakware, etc.I always come back to Ubuntu. I don't like snaps or the continuous error in the snap-store, but I feel that it is the most stable, modern and efficient distro.When I want to learn about Linux, I use other distributions, but when I want to work with Linux, I always go back to Ubuntu. I use flatpak because I like it better, nobody prevents it even if you don't have flatpak pre-installed.Oh! and Ubuntu is the only distro I've installed on all types of hardware (old imac, new hardware, old hardware) and it always works. It just all works."
3957,2023-07-09, Ubuntu, 22.04,9,1,"I have used Ubuntu Linux for years, and I have had good experiences with it most time.Firstly, it's user friendly. For someone switching from Windows to Linux, Ubuntu is a good start, not with a deep learning curve.Secondly, it's supported by many popular software: alternative web browsers, VPN client tools, RDP tools, software development tools, etc.Thirdly, when I get into some technical problems, it's easy to search for answers or discussions regarding Ubuntu Linux platform online. This saves my time for troubleshooting.I have tried Fedora Linux / RedHat Linux many times before. They are both user friendly. But at last, I decide to stay with Ubuntu, just for the convenience of troubleshooting and ease of getting supported software. Because I don't want to spend too much time on fixing the OS as a tool, rather use the OS as a tool to work on something else.The only problem I have with Ubuntu distro is the snap store. It gives me trouble of update from time to time, even I have reinstalled the entire OS. Hope it's more stable in their next update. But fortunately most applications can still be installed through regular repository.After all, I appreciate Ubuntu development team has contributed great work to the community for so many years. I can reply my daily work/life on this great product. Thank you all!"
3958,2023-07-03, Ubuntu, 22.10,8,0,"I like most of the Debian based system in the top 10 here on Distrowatch.  I started with Ubuntu in 2012.  I quit using it when it became slow, and when the color scheme became too clown-car for me. (gotta find my old review and take it down). I switched to Debian, which is more work on new hardware to update and configure, but in the end I got it to run well.  Recently, gave Ubuntu another try.  I was pleased to see the color scheme can now be modified.  I like a darker blue or green.  I know that's a silly thing to change over, but people do.  My other drive has Debian 12.  Debian 12 runs faster, but to be fair, the Debian nvme is a little faster.  anyway, I really like Ubuntu's more flexible color scheme, and I like having my task bar sit on the left, the icons.  It comes with less software bloat.  Snaps are faster now.  I am leaving it on my guest drive for now. The new Ubuntu 20.10 is much better than 18, last version I used.  I thought I should be fair and come back and leave Ubuntu an updated rating.  Aside: If you like gnome, and want something that just works, give Manjaro a try.  I know it's arch, but it has been stable for me for years on other machines, has new drivers, and the terminal shows you when you're making a error.  Fedora has a great driver set and is updated every six months as well, has Gnome that runs well.  "

There are pros and cons, but Ubuntu blows modern Windows out of the water. Much faster, way less bloat, no forced updates, not having Microsoft crap pushed onto you... there is some lack of compatibility and occasional annoyances, but this con will mostly go away as you use Linux.Compared to Mac OS, the main benefit is greater control over your computer. The toolbar, aesthetics, and an applications button that functions like Launchpad will make you feel right at home. If you use MacOS and need an extremely easy transition to Linux, try Elementary OS instead, but if you're at all technologically inclined- go with Ubuntu.I tried Linux Mint since it's more mainstream, but found it less straightforward and welcoming. I don't think Ubuntu is perfect, but it is a fantastic way to get started in the daunting world of Linux. Daily use will provide a mostly straightforward experience, with benefits the big two OS's can not reach.I hope this helps someone, as I've spent an hour writing and reviewing this review lol."

3962,2023-06-13, Ubuntu, 23.04,5,0,"For me Ubuntu is not one of the best distros in Linux for new users nor advanced, The first thing that i see like a problem are snaps, the slowest package format in all linux if you compare with the other ones, some snaps are fixed like firefox but things like libreoffice still really slow at opening the app (it can take 3 seconds or 4, in any other distribution whatever they use .deb, .rpm or flatpak it is instantly open).Some people try to defend snaps saying that you can install some propietary app like spotify or steam, but with .deb you could do that and in fact you still can do it, because .deb is the standard of most of Linux packages (unlike most of the other package formats) so trying to say ""snaps give us more software"" isn t a really good point, because .deb is by far more used and have more packages (also of propietary apps) than snapd or flatpak. Also you can read sometimes that snaps do is distribute more updated apps, but sometimes the .deb is more updated than the snap, so this isn t true...Snapd is good for servers, but at desktop it is simply useless, if you like things like ""universal package manager"" you should use .deb or flatpak, not this.Anothe problem of snapd is that it rely in not open source tecnology for servers, that cannot be replicate for any one (unlike other package formats that try to be universal, like flatpak for example, where you can create your own repositories, an example of that is  flathub, fedora...) Also the inestability of the Gnome version of Ubuntu is some kind of problematic, because it is a mix between versions of Gnome that can broke everything more easy than all apps at the same version (for example vanilla gnome 44).You cannot value a distribution based on nostalgia or bias, this distribution is mediocre if we compare it with the distributions that I recommend below, that does not mean that Ubuntu has not had the helm of linux at the desktop level for many years or that its team don t put effort into it so that everything goes more or less well, but it is no longer what it was.I recommend you using Linux Mint (.deb and flatpak support, easier for newbies and better for advanced users) , MX Linux ( The Linux Mint of Debian) , Opensuse (if you want a distro with newer software and stability, more graphical configuration than any distro) or Debian (Good old debian, better for servers than Ubuntu and for old PCs, more stable), for most people this will be a better experience.If you read my review I thank you for your time, I am sorry if my English is not the best, it is not my mother tongue"

Suddenly is says it needs to load snap, in my case for Firefox. You must fix snap on the OS to set the version of Firefox to be taken from the ppa of mozillateam.org. This goes the same way for all apps that were prior to the fix, and removal for snap. Bluetooth is really a mess. Seen this being a problem across the other distro's but is buggy without mercy in this version. Try to put Cinnamon Desktop on this version of Linux and you will get a system that crashes often and without giving you a chance to correct it. If you want a snap free environment, just load LInux Mint.  If you want a Linux environment that has the best support, then Ubuntu would be it. as a native install it is the fastest I have found and yet has the most offerings other than non .deb/snap Desktops versions.

3965,2023-06-04, Ubuntu, 23.04,9,1,"Ubuntu is still the best Linux desktop. Unlike Debian stable, it is reasonably up-to-date (even the LTS version gets new kernels, new point releases for the desktop environment, etc.) while being stable, has enormous third-party support behind it, ships with nonfree/patent encumbered software (hi Fedora/OpenSuse), the default Gnome desktop is faster than upstream due to the triple buffering patches, the built-in extensions are sensible and enhance the experience.People ramble on about snaps, but they are way better than they used to be. I recommend installing flatpak and getting most desktop apps from flathub, but keep whatever snaps are preinstalled (except maybe replace the snap-store with gnome-software), and occasionally install those apps as snaps which are officially supported (eg. spotify, vscode).The snap version of firefox is actually probably the best version of firefox on linux. It now supports basically everything while also always up-to-date and stays out of your way."

Like others I like the new installer which if nothing else adds a bit of needed modern look to what has become a stale looking installer. But its an installer so how often do you really see it? Performance wise I found everything has sped up a tick or so. Just feels snappier even on this weaker quad Celeron. I don't much care for Firefox anymore, but the Snap version launches better and is improved. Overall, navigating the OS just feels like things are getting polished up. "
3967,2023-05-30, Ubuntu, 22.04,10,1,"Gnome, in my opinion is the most polished Linux desktop environment but it is the least customizable and that is my major gripe with it. For instance, toggling between dark and light theme does not change the Gnome shell theme, which should be a given. I mean what's the point of a changing the theme if it does not change the shell theme out of the box. That is what Ubuntu gives. And that's what made me try it after years and years of staying away from it. And boy! was I pleasantly surprised. Ubuntu's take on Gnome is just amazing. It is exactly what vanilla Gnome should have been. Solid, stable, reliable, install once and forget, just use the system, with some basic customization options, these are some of the most important strengths of Ubuntu LTS.For anyone looking to be productive on a Linux system, I highly recommend Ubuntu LTS.

From Unity, Snaps, Mir, and more. But since 22.04 i've been noticing a constant increase in performance and a great out of the box user experience. Snaps and the changes behind the scenes in Gnome aren't the best ways of accomplishing those goals, but in practice they give a good experience. Canonical is investing in making their desktop better, look at the blog posts they release regarding improvements to Firefox and Steam's snaps. They are also receiving feedback to improve them, and they do some clever things with Snaps that are a great for new users (things like update pop-ups, automatic theme downloads) are annoying to more advanced users, but they help new users.Ubuntu gives a much better Gnome implementation than many, with accent colors, helpful extensions, sensible defaults (tap to click enabled for example) and in occasion they don't fear in holding back packages to avoid problems. Ubuntu 22.04 held back anything with libadwaita/gtk4, that give a lot of problems (in my case, making 22.10 unusable). 23.04 is a great release, it isn't the greatest in terms of features, but it more than compensates the user with a stable, problem free (can depend on your hardware) experience. The new installer is a lot nicer to use, especially in disk partitioning world (i remember the first time i used Ubiquity, the disk partitioning was confusing). Overall, 23.04, for not being the focus of Ubuntu (LTS rule), is a very reliable release that is unlikely to disappoint.You also get all the codecs with a button on install, and Ubuntu is smart enough to figure out drivers (or give the user a friendly way to install them)This sounds like we are in 2014 or something, but bad decision-making mainly from Fedora and OpenSUSE brought back all the hardware/driver/codec issues from the past. Requiring complicated setup for most users.Ubuntu kept the drivers! Even Debian is changing their old rules to allow proprietary drivers on installation. And if you dislike Snaps, just don't use them (or find a distro that suits you better)! Im not a fan, but i like having a backup option for flatpaks, its already saved me when Dolphin's flatpak stopped recognizing my controller."

A great job that in the not too distant future, will make most understand that Windows is not that important.The lInux world still has a long way to go in program compatibility between Windows and Linux, and as this progress allows for the possibility of maximum compatibility, the monopoly power of Windows will begin to be lost."
3970,2023-04-29, Ubuntu, 23.04,9,3,"Another six months, another minor release.The biggest surprise here is that the new installer is a big improvement on the old and very impressive for a ""v1"". Unexpectedly, it performs far better - there are no more annoying momentary pauses when typing on my system - and it certainly looks better.Once installed 23.04 is another ""steady as it goes"" release. There is not much change apart from the various improvements in GNOME 44, but some that are worth noting is that GNOME's device security panel is now available (Privacy > Device Security), not that it is particularly meaningful here as all hardware security, starting with Secure Boot, is switched off anyway, and there are massive improvements in accessibility (where the Accessibility option has been rearranged and, in particular, screen zoom greatly enhanced). I also note that the Ubuntu font, which hadn't changed for about 12 years, has been updated to support more Unicode character sets and also, by default, has thinner strokes.As usual, the big thing with a minor release is that everything is upgraded (kernel 6.2, python 3.11, LibreOffice 7.5 and so on).GNOME has progressively become less resource-hungry and faster, and I am amazed to note that GNOME Shell only uses 220MB of RAM on my system. I remember when it used several times that.The only slight oddity is that Transmission is v3.00, not the new and far superior v4. There is no indication why v4 is held back. It would also be useful if the excellent (GNOME) Extension Manager were included by default; at the moment there is no means of managing extensions out of the box as not even the (inferior) GNOME Extensions is installed.Overall, recommended. I would not upgrade from a LTS but an upgrade from 22.10, or a new install of 23.04, is a no-brainer."

It is rock solid, it is nicely themed tweaked to make GNOME even more functional and to make it look even more beautiful. Ubuntu keeps finding the sweet spot between FOSS and its openness to proprietary software and drivers. People who are totally immersed in the Linux world don't realize how spoiled we are these days with excellent distros like Fedora, Pop_OS, Endeavour OS, Linux Mint, Manjaro, etc. But the criticism that Ubuntu gets is just unfair. Not only is it the base distribution to a lot of these popular spin offs, but it also still is reliable in a way that other distros often aren't. This version in particular gets a 10/10 from me because of the perceived focus that is being put on the Ubuntu Desktop again by Canonical, by really refining it, perfecting the Ubuntu font family, creating new core apps like the new installer and optimizing functionality by means of the dock (now with counters on the icons), colour theming (ahead of Adwaita!).

But I think Ubuntu is still a solid distro, I like the UI, the general look and feel are good, the way the system works, it's everything out of the box, just install it and start working, or you can do your own little tweaks to make it switch better you.

To be honest, this is a problem of Debian non-stable branches, and Ubuntu just only inherited this.I've started with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS back in early 2018, and it was great, I really liked it, so, though I switched to another distro (not important which, but not an Ubuntu-based), I continued to follow the developments.

But for newer users not familiar with this it could lead to a negative Linux experience.My experience with snaps have been mixed just like their ability to auto update. I have not had any issues with flatpaks.As far as the rest of the system, Ubuntu is NOT a rock solid experience. The only way it's ""rock solid"" is if you don't use it.

It isn't Puppy though - it is actually built using a cut-down official Ubuntu 22.04 root filesystem under the hood. A slightly larger KLU-jamFE 611MiB iso that includes a non-snap PPA fetched Firefox is available for download at same place.However if you want to try say Gnome with Wayland you'd likely be better with official Ubuntu if you have the greater resources and speed provided by a recent modern machine."

4002,2022-11-21, Ubuntu, 22.10,10,0,"Best Ubuntu release for years. GTK4 with Wayland made Gnome much snappier and lighter. I don't know why there is so much hate on GTK4 - it destroys GTK3 for me. Ubuntu takes only about 700-800 MB of RAM on boot. It allmost same as XFCE and Mate, but here you have beautiful modern desktop with Wayland which is super fast even on integrated graphics. (tripple buffering did the job too) I am amazed how good Ubuntu and GNOME became. Much better and snappier than KDE for meKeep calm and use Ubuntu (you can remove snaps!)"
4003,2022-11-16, Ubuntu, 22.04,4,5,"They have literally ruined this distro. Ubuntu once was the reference for the Linux community, not anymore. It runs sloppy, slow and crashes frequently, not to mention very long freezes. I blame Snap packages for this but it is quite saddening what this distro has become. It is logical that most people have moved to other distros, like the Arch-based ones.What a shame, Ubuntu.PS: Did I mention your privacy is compromised if you use this distro? By using Ubuntu you just accept to be part of a product and we are people, not products."
4004,2022-11-10, Ubuntu, 22.10,10,0,"Ubuntu, as always very stable. Excellent progress Ubuntu with Gnome 43. Now it makes sense to use Gnome Files (nautilus), because now it has high-level file system features.For years I wanted to have Ubuntu, but the Files system level was very limited, so I turned to other options.Anyway, as I always say, the level of Linux distributions, at least the ones I've tried, continue to show impressive progress. I have tested some of the best known, such as Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Lubuntu, Xubuntu, Kde Neon, Linux Mint, Manjaro with Plasma, Arco Linux with Plasma, Mx Linux, among others, and I cannot say anything else that they are all works of high level computer engineering.I only have words of encouragement and gratitude for all those who directly or indirectly participate in this world of the free system."
4005,2022-11-09, Ubuntu, 22.10,10,0,"For me, the best all-terrain distribution there is, simple, fast and stable... One thing or another, but it is because the range of PCs is very large and cannot cover all the hardware... I am a user between basic and intermediate and ubuntu offers me everything I need... Honestly I have tried other ""light"" ones that make my fans sound... This one that is ""heavy"" because of gnome and others... It is so light, fast and fluid. Thank you Ubuntu... i know will continue to improve over the years... i use nvidia

4006,2022-08-11, YunoHost, 4.1.8,7,2,"
I've used Yunohost in the past. It's quite a decent tool for beginners looking to host their own apps, and it comes with pretty much all you need in order to get started. You simply choose the app you want from a big list and you're walked through a short installation. No real technical knowledge needed. It also provides a free dns/tunneling service so you can access a local server over public net. That being said, it doesn't always work. Installation took several attempts. For whatever reason, the installer would fail on a fresh drive. Certain apps would break, or not start. Also, if you operate behind a network without total control, you probably won't be able to access some of the features. The documentation for deploying your own apps I found confusing, personally. Worst of all, it's locked into a single version of a single distribution in Debian 11. And the install of the OS must be pristine. You cannot install on any Debian-derivatives or other versions.So, it's good, but not quite great. I found a more refined alternative in caprover, so it's worth checking that one out, and I have gained more technical knowledge over the years leading to less of a reliance on such tools."
4007,2021-06-20, YunoHost, 4.1.8,10,1,"Been struggling with self-hosting a few things on my ubuntu server for a few years now, but after switching to yunohost my life was mad much easier. Basically any popular app can be installed via a few clicks in the graphical interface, from mastodon instances to minecraft servers. 10/10 would install again."
4008,2021-01-13, YunoHost, 3.6.4.6,10,0,"It's a plug and play Distro for an Opensource ecosystem.Many packaged applications that are also supported on ARM and a very user-friendly interface.I have it on a Raspberry-pi3 runnig :-Wordpress-Photo gallery -Matrix server-Nextcloud-Email-PadsAnd it runs smoothly.

Slackware does everything CRUX does but much better.  CRUX is bare-bones to the point of being almost completely useless.  There is no task in CRUX that can't be done better in any other Linux system.  If you really want something bare-bones and UNIX-like, Slackware is a much better experience.  CRUX has no options built in for a desktop environment.  If you want to use anything other than a standalone window manager like openbox or twm, your only option is to use a community-maintained repository.  These are very hard to use and many of them are missing parts.  I was *barely* able to cobble MATE together.  It took hours and I had to install multiple dependencies manually from source because the port versions weren't recognized for some reason.  Most packages had to be manually installed by force because of a footprint mismatch.  Once MATE was finally ready, it barely worked.  Most of the menus didn't work and many components were missing.  Even if you don't want a desktop environment, installing basically any software is a horrible experience.  Although the same could be said for Slackware, its SlackBuild system, while annoying to use, is at least functional.  Plus, Slackware, in spite of its narrow repositories, has enough available in its default installation for most use cases.  CRUX has basically nothing.  "
4010,2023-07-21, CRUX, 3.7,10,3,"I came across this distro very recently after having been on Artix for many years, before that on Arch, before that Manjaro, before that Debian, before that Mint, before that Ubuntu, before that Red Hat.So I kind of went gradually from the more abstract to the most simple (perhaps KISS is even simpler).What I have to say about CRUX is, I love it!Everything is open and out of your way, it makes understanding the system extremely easy, the community is very friendly, no Code of Conduct (which is very rare to see these days, but a lack of a COC is a clear sign of a project being aimed at responsible grown ups), just due to the nature of source-based distro's, it takes forever to get my system ready for daily use, but I think it's worth it in the end.I also love the choice of a simple BSD-style init script system, because it really makes you understand how an init system works under the hood, and if you really need your own equivelant of ""systemctl ACTION PROGRAM"", you can always make a 1 line shell script (or 2 lines if you count the ""/bin/sh"" header), put it in /usr/bin, and use it.Making ports is super easy and funnily enough it's front and center of their documentation, so much so that besides the base installation process, documentation doesn't talk about much else, but that's simply because there's no need for it.Everything apart from the ports system and init system is just a raw Linux experience, so whatever you've learned in other distributions can be applied in CRUX very easily.In many ways, CRUX feels like what Arch could have been if they'd stick to their philosophy.I also feel like CRUX is much cleaner too, because in Arch when you install from the AUR, it quickly starts to feel like you're running software compiled by mutually incompatible maintainers with each their own opinion on how to do things, but in CRUX there are a certain set of rules for making ports to keep things as clean as possible, even if you enable ports from many different users.At the same time it also feels like a freer (as in freedom), smaller, and more standardized version of Gentoo.Before trying CRUX, I viewed compiling literally everything from source as a meme, but now I really love it.Works great on laptops and desktops, but if you're looking for a server that's just as KISS as CRUX, consider OpenBSD instead."
4011,2021-12-12, CRUX, 3.6.1,8,11,"This linux distro is really great, it has the customization of gentoo with the freedom of slack and the installation is arch-like (probably because arch formed from crux's philosophy), But i'll have to say that this distro is not for the beginner nor for the intermediate, as many issues that you'll encounter is not very easy to fix.For example: some of the processes were a pain, even though i followed the documentation I still encountered issues with some of the commands needed missing in the installation medium, so, if you have a problem, then you are on your own when it comes to fixing issues during and after the installation.Sadly, for those who want Freedom, this distro doesn't offer a Libre-kernel, but with some hard work you can get a Libre-kernel working after the installation.Finally. If you are dedicated to the crux cause, you should make a custom repository for software, keep on K.I.S.S-ing!"
4012,2021-05-27, CRUX, 3.6.1,10,20,"Very enjoyable old school source distribution, clean, lightweight and fast!With a good documentation and simple packages building process.Have good compilation time!

4013,2023-07-19, NexentaStor, 4.0.4,8,0,"
Nexentastor is obviously intended for a specific use-case/target audience, but it does what it's meant to do quite well, without the bloat/security vulns that many general purpose linux distros are plagued by. It's obviously not the distro of choice for the folks that think anything shy of public domain is a sin against Linux, but the generous free tier for anyone with less than 4tb of storage shows the company is far from being a group of  soul sucking fascists overly fixated on profit like whoever decided to ruin RedHat.
