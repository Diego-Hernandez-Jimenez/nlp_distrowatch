## NLP project with distrowatch reviews


Some time ago I was thinking about making the transition to a linux based operating system and I was very interested in knowing things about the world of free software and linux culture. At one point, I ended up finding the distrowatch website, a site where you can find information about countless linux distributions. And of course, it also has reviews. The structured format in which they were found and the fact that each comment was accompanied by a numerical score gave me an idea; I could collect tens, hundreds (or thousands!) of reviews and analyze them using NLP. That idea finally came to fruition and the result can be found here
