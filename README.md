## NLP project with distrowatch reviews


Some time ago, I contemplated transitioning to a Linux-based operating system, driven by my curiosity about the realm of free software and Linux culture. During my exploration, I stumbled upon the Distrowatch website (an invaluable resource offering information about numerous Linux distributions, including reviews). The organized and very structured layout of these reviews, coupled with the inclusion of numerical scores, sparked an idea within me. I envisioned gathering a substantial collection of these reviews—ranging from tens to potentially thousands—and subjecting them to analysis through Natural Language Processing (NLP). Eventually, this idea materialized into a tangible project, the outcome of which can be accessed here.
